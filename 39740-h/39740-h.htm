  <h3>PREFACE</h3>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/s.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="S"
  title="S" /></span>INCE the appearance, in 1900, of the excellent work of Mr.
  John Kimberly Mumford on Oriental Rugs, the public interest in
  these fabrics has so largely increased that the author feels
  warranted in offering this monograph, which aims to treat the
  subject in a way that will not only appeal to the general reader
  but be of value to the student.</p>

  <p>In the chapter entitled &ldquo;Rug Weaving Before the XVIII
  Century&rdquo; is a brief review of some of the notable
  achievements in this branch of art; and in order that the public
  may as far as possible have access to the masterpieces described,
  the carpets on exhibition in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
  New York have been given unusual prominence. The chapters on
  &ldquo;How to Distinguish Rugs&rdquo; and on &ldquo;Purchasing
  Rugs&rdquo; should prove serviceable to those who are collecting
  or are buying for use; and the chapter on &ldquo;Weaving&rdquo;
  contains many details which have not previously received from
  connoisseurs the consideration they deserve.</p>

  <p>The descriptions of all but the least important classes of
  rugs in the Persian, Asia Minor, Caucasian, and Central Asiatic
  groups include not only a general statement of their most
  striking features, but also a technical analysis that is termed
  &ldquo;Type Characteristics.&rdquo; It should be understood,
  however, that these characteristics are not invariable, but are
  remarkably constant. They may interest chiefly those who aim to
  acquire expert information, yet they will doubtlessly prove
  valuable to every owner of a rug as a means for its
  identification.</p>

  <p>It would be difficult to acknowledge all the assistance
  received by the author since he began the study of rugs; for
  sometimes a mere suggestion has started a line of investigation
  resulting in interesting discoveries. He has freely consulted
  well-known authorities, who are quoted in the body of the work;
  and has received valuable suggestions and assistance from Messrs.
  T. S. Hawley, of Santa Barbara, Cal., George Harootunian and
  Frank Loftus, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id=
  "Page_vi">vi</a></span> Los Angeles, Cal.; George Stevenson, of
  New York; G. Graf, of the Persische Teppiche Gesellschaft, of
  Tabriz; and P. de Andrea &amp; Co., of Constantinople. He
  gratefully acknowledges the permission of Messrs. C. F. Williams,
  of Norristown, Penn., and James F. Ballard, of St. Louis, Mo., to
  study their valuable collections; and the permission of Dr.
  Wilhelm R. Valentiner, Curator of Decorative Arts in the
  Metropolitan Museum in New York, to examine the carpets of the
  museum and to take photographs of them. He also wishes
  particularly to mention the kindness of the following collectors
  and firms who have allowed their rugs to be used for
  illustrations: Miss Emily Davis, of Buffalo, N. Y.; the Misses
  Palache, and Messrs. Nathan Bentz and T. S. Hawley, of Santa
  Barbara, Cal.; Mr. R. Y. Struble, of Fredericktown, Ohio; Mr. E.
  L. Pierce, of Syracuse, N.Y.; Mr. H. C. Merritt, of Pasadena,
  Cal.; Mr. J. F. Ballard, of St. Louis, Mo.; Mr. C. F. Williams,
  of Norristown, Penn.; Major L. B. Lawton, U.S.A., of Seneca
  Falls, N.Y.; Messrs. Mihran &amp; Co., of Los Angeles, Cal.;
  Messrs. B. Altman &amp; Co., Benguiat &amp; Keresey, Wm.
  Baumgarten &amp; Co., Jones &amp; Brindisi, Jos. Wild &amp; Co.,
  W. &amp; J. Sloane, and the Tiffany Studios, of New York City. He
  is also indebted to Vincent Robinson &amp; Co., Ltd., of London,
  for the use of the colour plate of the Royal Garden Carpet, now
  owned by them, and to the Royal Victoria and Albert Museum, South
  Kensington, London, for permission to obtain a colour plate of
  the Holy Carpet of the Mosque of Ardebil.</p>

  <h2>ORIENTAL RUGS</h2>

  <h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

  <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/i.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="I"
  title="I" /></span>T is not altogether surprising that in a most
  materialistic age many of a race distinguished more for its
  utilitarian than artistic accomplishments should fail to see in
  Oriental carpets high artistic expression; yet during the last
  twenty years choice specimens have been sold for sums which not
  only are very large, but show a tendency to increase with each
  succeeding year. In 1893 a woollen rug, known as the Ardebil
  carpet and regarded, on account of its beautiful designs and
  exquisite colours, as one of the finest products of Oriental art,
  was purchased for the South Kensington Museum. Since it had a
  length of thirty-four and a half feet with a breadth of seventeen
  and a half, the price of &pound;2500, which was the sum paid, was
  at the rate of twenty dollars per square foot. At an auction sale
  in New York in 1910,<a name="FNanchor_1" id=
  "FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> a
  woollen rug five and a half feet long by three and three quarters
  wide was sold for the sum of $10,200, or at the rate of four
  hundred and ninety-one dollars per square foot; and a silk rug
  seven feet and two inches long by six feet and four inches wide
  was sold for the sum of $35,500, or at the rate of nine hundred
  and thirty dollars per square foot. As it was the general opinion
  of connoisseurs that the prices paid for these two rugs were low,
  and as it is well known that these rugs are not more valuable
  than some others of equal size, it is not unreasonable to assume
  that many of the best judges of Oriental rugs would declare that
  at the present time the sum of five hundred dollars per square
  foot is a fair price for some antique woollen rugs, and the sum
  of one thousand dollars per square foot a fair price for some
  antique silk rugs.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id=
  "Page_16">16</a></span></p>

  <p>If these judges were asked on what they based their opinion of
  the value of these old pieces, which are less serviceable for
  wear than new rugs that can be bought of an American factory at
  twenty cents per square foot, they might with reason reply that
  they are works of art, woven in those days when Michelangelo,
  Titian, Rubens, and Rembrandt were busy in their studios; that
  they are as scarce as the paintings of these masters; and that
  they might justly be compared with them in beauty and artistic
  execution. Though granting that the technique of weaving makes it
  impossible to represent a design as perfectly as can be done with
  a brush, they would claim that the drawing of dainty vines,
  scrolls, and arabesques was often represented by lines that in
  abstract beauty of form are unsurpassed, and that no artist had
  ever produced from his palette colours which equalled in
  brilliant sheen and marvellously changing hue those of the woven
  masterpieces.</p>

  <p>Whoever is inclined to disagree with these judges and with
  those art critics of Europe and America who assert that in an
  aesthetic sense the people of the Orient are cultured to a
  standard beyond the comprehension of the Western world, should
  remember that the taste for any kind of art is based on
  convention and is largely a matter of cultivation. The
  Occidental, who for generations has cultivated the taste for
  paintings and statuary, looks to the painter and sculptor for the
  highest expression of artistic genius; but the Oriental takes
  greater delight in his marvellous creations of porcelain or woven
  fabrics. There is, too, a marked difference in treatment. The
  Occidental demands that in art &ldquo;everything should be stated
  with the utmost fullness of a tedious realism before he can grasp
  its meaning&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2" id=
  "FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and
  fails to recognise the more subtle beauty of various forms of
  Oriental art. The Oriental, on the other hand, is far less
  realistic and is better satisfied if his subject suggests
  abstract qualities that depend for their fullest appreciation on
  those quickening experiences that at different times have touched
  the soul of the observer. Moreover, as Buddhism, which prevails
  in many of the countries of Asia, teaches that a universal spirit
  is manifested in each form of nature, determining its character,
  and a similar idea pervades other religions of the East, the
  highest aim of Asiatic art is to express that inner spirit. It is
  largely this difference in artistic cultivation that accounts for
  the difference in taste. Whoever then would fully appreciate
  these rugs must view <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id=
  "Page_17">17</a></span>them not only with an eye trained to see
  the beautiful harmonies of colour and design, but with the
  artistic temperament of the Oriental.</p>

  <p>By study and cultivation the European as well as the American
  is growing to value more highly the products of Oriental art.
  When the old sea captains carried on trade with Japan, they
  imported into Europe large quantities of Imari ware, which the
  Japanese purposely decorated with crude and vulgar colours to
  meet the less refined taste of the Europeans, who regarded many
  of them as fine specimens of ceramic art and studiously copied
  them in their factories. But so great has been the change in
  artistic taste since then that now they are valued principally as
  objects of curiosity. Likewise, many beautiful Japanese
  Makimonos, in which a few strong lines gave but a hint of the
  essential thought, formerly passed before the eyes of Europeans
  as the paintings of semi-barbarians. But now we begin to see, as
  did Whistler, that they are often the products of great genius
  and that they express thought and feeling with marvellous power.
  There has been a similar growth in the appreciation of Oriental
  rugs. Even within the last generation this growth has been
  apparent, so that the few who wisely bought those old worn pieces
  which thirty years ago hung at doors of little shops where
  dark-faced foreigners invited acquaintance, are now the envy of
  the many who, too late, have learned that to-day they can
  scarcely be bought at any price.</p>

  <p>The more we study the several fields of art in the Orient, the
  better we realise the wonderful creative genius of its people and
  learn to value the products of any one field. Japan has awakened
  the admiration of the highest art critics for its bronzes, some
  of which exceed in size any other castings in the world, and for
  its netsuk&eacute;s, which are the smallest of carvings. Its
  blades of steel are superior to those of Damascus and Toledo; and
  its lacquer, which is the most wonderful of its artistic
  products, displays genius of a very high order. To China, a
  country that we often regard as barbarous, we owe the invention
  of silks, the printing press, and gunpowder; yet it is in
  porcelain, that was manufactured even in those days when Caesar
  was marching with his legions against the barbarous races of
  Central and Northern Europe, that China has surpassed the world
  and set a standard that probably will never again be reached. In
  the land where glide the Indus and the Ganges stand temples,
  erected by the descendants of the house of Tamerlane,
  be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id=
  "Page_18">18</a></span>fore which the beholder, even if familiar
  with the wonders of St. Peter&rsquo;s, is lost in admiration of
  the intricate delicacy of detail, the majesty of proportions, and
  the gorgeous splendour of colour with which some of the spirit of
  the East is expressed in material form. When we realise that in
  these different lines of artistic effort the genius of Asia has
  rivalled and surpassed that of Europe and America, we become the
  better prepared to believe that choice specimens of woven
  fabrics, in weaving which every class of every country of Asia
  has been engaged from time immemorial, are to be regarded as
  works of the highest art.</p>

  <p>However pleasing the design or elaborate the detail, it is
  principally in the colouring that these rugs claim our interest
  and admiration. The colours which are derived from vegetable or
  animal dyes grow more mellow and beautiful with passing years,
  and applied to wools of finest texture acquire a lustre and
  softness which in the choicest specimens are like the radiant
  throat of a humming bird, or tints at the close of an autumn day.
  The different shades have different moods, expressing peace, joy,
  pensiveness, sorrow, the deep meaning of which the Oriental mind
  with its subtle and serious imagination has grasped as has none
  other. Moreover, in all truly fine pieces there is perfect
  harmony of tone. It is in this richness, suggestiveness, and
  harmony that the greatest artistic value lies.</p>

  <p>That all do not appreciate these qualities is not because they
  do not exist; for the keen perception of colour, like the keen
  perception of music, is a faculty granted to one person but
  denied to another. Even to those who take delight in colour there
  are different degrees of appreciation. &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo;
  said John Ruskin, &ldquo;we none of us enough appreciate the
  nobleness and sacredness of colour.&rdquo; But as the ear can be
  cultivated to a higher taste for music, so can the eye be
  cultivated to a higher taste for colour; and to fully appreciate
  the beauties of Oriental rugs it is necessary to develop this
  faculty to its fullest extent.</p>

  <p>And yet it is not alone as works of art that Oriental rugs
  interest us. They suggest something of the life and religious
  thought of the people who made them. Some seem redolent with the
  fragrance of flowers, others reflect the spirit of desert wastes
  and wind-swept steppes. So, too, in the colours and designs of
  some appear the symbols of that mysticism with which the minds of
  the followers of Zoroaster in their effort to commune with the
  unseen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id=
  "Page_19">19</a></span> forces of the universe were imbued; and
  though the original meaning of many of these symbols has been
  forgotten, the study of others leads to a better understanding of
  the life-thought of the weavers.</p>

  <p>Realising, then, that Asia has been the cradle from which has
  come the highest expression of many forms of artistic
  achievement, and that the Western mind is now assigning to its
  woven fabrics their proper place in the galleries of art, we may
  begin the study of Oriental rugs with the assurance that the
  further it is pursued the greater will be the appreciation and
  delight. It will take us among strange and interesting people,
  and over fields that were historic grounds before the walls of
  Rome were built. It will lead beyond the dome of St. Sophia to
  the land of the Arabian tales, where the splendour of former days
  is reflected in tomb and mosque, and where, perhaps, when the
  Western world grows old, there will rise again from crumbling
  ruins another nation that will revive the poetic and artistic
  genius of the East with all the majesty and creative power of the
  past.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

  <h4>PHYSICAL FEATURES AND HISTORY OF THE RUG-PRODUCING LANDS</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/t.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="T"
  title="T" /></span>HE artistic character of Oriental rugs, like
  every other artistic impulse, is subject to the influence of
  physical environment. This influence is not alone that to which
  an individual weaver has been subjected, but is the transmitted
  effect of the accumulated experiences of many generations. It
  appears in the colours which simulate tones displayed by varying
  phases of nature, and also in the designs or symbols which,
  derived from older types by a long process of evolution,
  partially reflect feelings engendered in a people of highly
  imaginative and poetic temperament by long contact with elemental
  forces. Moreover, the quality of material used depends almost
  exclusively on the climate and physical conditions of countries
  where it is produced. Accordingly, the artistic and essential
  characteristics of rugs are better understood by a knowledge of
  the salient physical features of the countries where they are
  woven.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

  <p>The principal Oriental countries that continue to produce rugs
  are China, India, Afghanistan, Beluchistan, Persia, Turkestan,
  Caucasia, and Asia Minor. As all of them are contiguous, they may
  be regarded as a geographic unit; and though there is much
  diversity of detail, there is also much in common. From near the
  western boundary of Asia Minor a vast plateau stretches eastward
  into Central Asia, increasing in altitude towards the east.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id=
  "Page_21">21</a></span></p>

  <p>Its mean elevation in Asia Minor is from two thousand to three
  thousand feet, and as it extends beyond the Zagros Mountains and
  crosses the northern half of Persia, it rises from four thousand
  to five thousand feet. Continuing eastward through Southern
  Turkestan and Afghanistan it increases in altitude until it has
  risen to nearly twelve thousand feet in the lofty table-lands of
  Central Asia, where it begins to descend as it extends farther
  into the desert of Gobi. From the western part of this plateau a
  spur extends northward between the Black and Caspian seas, to
  form the high table-land of Caucasia, which has a mean elevation
  of about seven thousand feet.</p>

  <p>The general topographic features of this plateau include great
  stretches of comparatively level land, broad tracts from which
  there is no drainage to the sea, and sandy desert wastes. On
  almost every side it is bounded by mountain chains and is
  intersected by transverse ridges that lift still higher peaks
  where rests the perpetual snow. Throughout the deserts and large
  parts of the table-lands the rainfall is slight, so that there
  are but few important river courses.</p>

  <p>The cultivated portions of this vast area are relatively
  small, and consist largely of strips of land in fertile valleys,
  through which flow perennial streams. From time immemorial these
  streams have been used for irrigation, and the inhabitants of the
  districts have prospered by abundant harvests. In one or another
  of these valleys have been built the principal cities, within the
  walls of which were imposing temples that stimulated religious
  fervour, schools of learning to quicken the intellect, and
  gardens where perfumed flowers and the songs of birds delighted
  the aesthetic senses. In these cities science, philosophy,
  religion, and art received their highest development. In them
  lived the most skilled artisans and artists of the Orient; and
  the products of the loom were of the finest quality.</p>

  <p>Beyond these valleys are great stretches of uncultivated
  tracts consisting of plains, hills, and mountains. Some of these
  tracts are naturally fertile and could be made productive, but at
  present are used only for pasturage, and over them numberless
  tribes of fierce nomads drive their flocks of sheep. On the other
  hand, where the land has no drainage to the sea, so that the
  streams and rivers that flow into it empty into small lakes or
  are finally absorbed, the soil becomes impregnated with alkali
  deposited from the waters, and the grass is<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span> scanty.
  There are also sandy wastes of great extent where scarcely any
  animal life can exist. Moreover in many parts of the country the
  rain falls only during a few months of the year, and more
  abundantly in the higher altitudes, so that the nomads are
  constantly searching for fresh pasturage, and moving from the
  lowlands, where the grass dies after the rainy season, to the
  higher altitudes, from which they return again at the approach of
  winter. So numerous are the flocks that in the struggle for
  pasture the weaker tribes are driven to the poorer land.</p>

  <p>The pastoral life, the necessity of moving from place to
  place, the strife resulting from the difference in quality of
  pasture, have affected the temperament and character of the
  people. The boundless stretches of land, the clear atmosphere,
  the burning desert sands, the delicate mirage, and the starry
  heavens, have made men hospitable, thoughtful, devotional;
  constant wanderings have made them independent; the struggle for
  pasturage has made them lawless and cruel. These qualities are
  reflected to some extent in their woven fabrics, which lack the
  high artistic finish of those woven in cities. A large proportion
  of them are prayer rugs and contain symbols of the sun and fire
  worship. The designs are barbaric, and many are doubtless the
  same as those used hundreds of years ago. The colours of the old
  pieces, woven on upland plains or in mountain fastnesses, blend
  less harmoniously than those woven by more cultured weavers; but
  they frequently possess rich, pure tones, which are no longer
  seen in the modern rugs. As even a partial expression of the
  thoughts and feelings of a people, there are no rugs from the
  Orient more worthy of study than the rare old pieces woven by
  nomadic tribes.</p>

  <p>Not only physical environment but the conquests of foreign
  enemies, as well as political struggles at home, have had an
  important influence on all art. It will be of interest,
  therefore, to briefly review the histories of Central and
  Southwestern Asia, where rugs have been made for over three
  thousand years, in order to understand the different racial
  influences which have affected their artistic development.</p>

  <p>In the rich valleys near the mouths of the Tigris and
  Euphrates dwelt in the remote past a race of unknown origin
  called Sumerians, and to the north of them lived another people
  known as the Accadians. These races built canals, cultivated the
  soil, established towns, and invented the cuneiform writing. They
  lived in harmony <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id=
  "Page_23">23</a></span>with one another, and continued to prosper
  until about 3000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when the
  Semitic race of the Chaldees, appearing from an unknown land,
  subdued them. The Chaldees, however, allowed the conquered races
  to retain part of their lands, adopted their civilisation, and
  about the year 2500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> built the
  city of Babylon, the foundation of which biblical students claim
  was laid by the mighty hunter Nimrod. By cultivating the
  surrounding country, by developing its trade and commerce, the
  Babylonians became a wealthy and powerful nation; and by
  encouraging manufactures, art, and science, they became noted for
  their delicate fabrics, magnificent temples, and knowledge of
  mathematics and astronomy.</p>

  <p>About the year 2000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> a number
  of tribesmen, among whom was Abraham, migrated with their flocks
  to the upper valleys of the Tigris and founded Nineveh. A century
  later the land occupied by colonists who settled about Nineveh
  was known as Assyria. It increased in numbers and in power until,
  in 1300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, it gained its first
  victory over Babylon; and during the next four hundred years,
  though meeting with occasional reverses, it extended its rule
  over Babylonia, Asia Minor, and Assyria, and received tribute
  even from Egypt. It thus became the first great conquering power
  in Southwestern Asia. In their magnificent palaces of Nineveh,
  surrounded by luxury, the rulers of Assyria were resting in
  supposed security when a powerful and unexpected enemy appeared
  from the land now known as Persia.</p>

  <p>When the valleys of the Tigris and the Euphrates were
  inhabited by Sumerians and Accadians, Iran, which included modern
  Persia, was similarly inhabited by races of unknown origin.
  Subsequently, but at an exceedingly remote period, from the
  region about the Oxus river in Western Asia two branches of the
  great Aryan family migrated to Iran. One of these, which settled
  in the northern part, was known as the Medes; the other, which
  settled in the southern part, was known as the Persians. Both
  Medes and Persians subdued the native races and in the course of
  centuries constructed powerful empires. The former were the first
  to extend their conquests, and forming an alliance with the
  viceroy of Babylon they attacked Nineveh in the year 606
  <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> and destroyed it. Babylon now
  became the mistress of all Mesopotamia, and under Nebuchadnezzar
  it was enlarged to cover an area of one hundred square miles, and
  surrounded by walls three hundred feet high. These walls enclosed
  parks, orchards, gardens, and a city that soon be<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>came famous
  for its palaces, its temple of Bel, and its Hanging Gardens.</p>

  <p>While Babylon was rising in power changes were occurring in
  Iran. Cyrus, leader of the Persians, instigated a revolt against
  the Medes and conquered them. But not satisfied with making the
  Persians rulers of Iran he extended his conquests westward, and
  in the year 538 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, by diverting the
  waters of the Euphrates, surprised Belshazzar in his banquet hall
  and became master of Babylonia. The complete subjection of all
  Asia Minor followed, and for the next two centuries the warlike
  Persians were the dominant power in Western Asia. But in the year
  331 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when Alexander the Great
  defeated their armies under Darius, the Persian Empire melted
  away.</p>

  <p>Whether in Egypt or China or by the Tigris the art of weaving
  first took definite form, it was in this land of Babylon and
  Nineveh, of the Medes and the Persians, of Abraham, Belshazzar,
  and Cyrus, where a few remaining monuments attest the delicate
  textiles of those early days, that in more recent ages have been
  woven the most perfect carpets of which there is any
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>During the succeeding five hundred years Persia, Asia Minor,
  Caucasia, and Syria became the prey of the Parthians, Greeks, and
  Romans, to whom petty tribes, recognising no sovereign power and
  secure in their mountain fastnesses, bade occasional defiance.
  About the year 226 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> an able
  leader of one of the Persian tribes founded the dynasty of the
  Sassanides, which during the reign of Chosroes (531-579
  <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>) and his grandson Chosroes II
  (590-628 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>) ruled over the country
  from the Oxus on the north to Arabia and Egypt on the south, and
  from India on the east to Assyria on the west. This was a period
  of prosperity and luxury, the glory of which continued until the
  middle of the VII Century, when it was overthrown by a new power
  rising from a most unexpected quarter.</p>

  <p>In the inhospitable land of Arabia, noted for its coffee,
  dates, and myrrh, for its dreary, sandy, waterless wastes, a land
  hitherto almost unknown in history, Mohammed promulgated the
  religion which, suited to the temperament and desires of the
  Bedouins, united them into a fanatic, militant body of
  conquerors. After his death his successors, known as the Caliphs,
  extended his conquests. Their successful armies quickly overran
  Persia and overthrew the Sassanian rule; then marching northward
  into Turkestan and as far east as the Indus they overcame all
  resistance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id=
  "Page_25">25</a></span> From the Greeks, by whom they were known
  as the Saracens, they snatched Palestine and Syria, and invading
  Egypt, conquered it after the long stubborn siege of Alexandria.
  A little later the Arabs became masters of Northern Africa, and
  settling there intermarried with the native races. Near the
  Straits of Gibraltar their African descendants, known as the
  Moors, crossed to Spain, where in the year 711 they vanquished a
  powerful army that opposed them. During the following year they
  subdued all of that country and began an invasion of Northern
  Europe. But on the rich pasture lands near Tours, where the
  infantry of Charles Martel met the Mussulman cavalry in one of
  the most decisive battles of history, they were defeated with
  terrible slaughter and Christian Europe was saved.</p>

  <p>These conquests of the Mohammedans had not only a political
  and religious significance, but also an important influence on
  art at a time when Europe was sunk in ignorance and barbarism.
  Fond of magnificence and luxury, the Caliphs founded great
  capitals in Assyria, Egypt, and Spain, and built palaces that
  have histories which sound like fairy tales. Bagdad on the banks
  of the Tigris, with its sixteen hundred canals, one hundred and
  five bridges, and nearly a million people, with its countless
  baths, its many thousand mosques, and its royal palace, where was
  collected the best of Asiatic taste, elegance, and splendour,
  possessed more grandeur than any other city in the world. Gibbon
  states that within the palace, furnished with Oriental luxury,
  hung thirty-eight thousand pieces of tapestry, one third of which
  were of silk embroidered with gold, and that on the floors lay
  twenty-two thousand carpets. In Cairo and in Cordova, likewise,
  the Caliphs surrounded themselves with similar splendour, of
  which, unfortunately, but few traces now exist; but the Castle of
  the Alhambra still remains as a powerful reminder of their taste
  and artistic genius. It is largely to the influence of this race
  that were due many of the beautiful Spanish rugs such as Queen
  Eleanor in the XIII Century took to England from Cordova and
  Granada, as well as those of other periods. Moreover, in some of
  the choicest pieces of Asia Minor and Persia, woven during the
  XVI and XVII Centuries, are traces of this early Saracenic
  art.</p>

  <p>For about five centuries the militant power of these
  Mohammedans was dominant in Southwestern Asia when another
  conquering race appeared. The great wall of China, which was
  built over two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id=
  "Page_26">26</a></span> hundred years before Christ by the famous
  Che-Hwang-te, to protect it against the invasions of the Tartars,
  turned westward many wandering hordes from the more fertile
  pastures and valleys of Southeastern Asia. One of these hordes
  was of Turks, who, leaving their homes near the sources of the
  Irtish and Yenisei rivers in the Altai Mountains, settled in
  Turkestan. Many centuries afterwards, to escape from other hordes
  pressing westward and to reach fresh pastures, different branches
  of them migrated southward and westward. About the year 1000
  <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> one of these branches known as
  the Seljukian Turks gained a foothold in Persia, and under Malek
  Shah, in 1072, made Ispahan its capital. About the same time it
  extended its power over Asia Minor and overran Georgia, where it
  destroyed the capital Tiflis after slaughtering the inhabitants.
  To this Turkoman race should probably be accredited the earliest
  Mongolian influence on Persian textile art.</p>

  <p>Somewhat later a people numbering forty thousand tents were
  ranging that part of Mongolia which lies north of the desert of
  Gobi in search of pasture and water. One of their number gathered
  about him a few followers, and by his own genius gained the
  ascendency over his tribes. He then allied himself with another
  powerful tribe, and reducing to obedience all the Mongolians who
  dwelt north of the desert of Gobi, in 1206, in the presence of
  his chiefs, he assumed the title of Genghis Khan. After becoming
  the ruler of millions of nomads of the great central plateau of
  Asia and conquering part of China, which was then enjoying a
  period of great wealth and prosperity, he invaded Western Asia.
  Bokhara offered no resistance and might have been spared, but
  learning that some of the Sultan&rsquo;s garrison were concealed
  he ordered the city to be burned. Samarkand, which surrendered
  after three days&rsquo; siege, was pillaged and the inhabitants
  were slaughtered. Herat appeased his anger by opening its gates.
  Even his death did not stop the ravages of the Mongol horde that
  captured and sacked Bagdad, and, crossing the Tigris and
  Euphrates, pillaged all Asia Minor. In 1258, Hulaku Khan,
  grandson of Genghis, conquered Persia and established his capital
  in the province of Azerbijan, where his descendants ruled for
  over a century.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 2. Meshed
    Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>With these invasions another wave of Mongolian influence was
  felt in Western Asia. Whatever may have been the effect on local
  art by the settlement of the Seljukian Turks in Persia and Asia
  Minor during the early part of the XI Century, it was
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id=
  "Page_27">27</a></span>inappreciable as compared with that of
  Genghis Khan and his followers. For the influence of Bagdad over
  Southwestern Asia was like that of Rome over the empire of the
  C&aelig;sars, and when in the middle of the XIII Century it was
  plundered for forty days, and other important cities of Asia
  Minor and Persia similarly treated, there was no longer the same
  incentive to work, so that art for a time languished. But in some
  cities the artistic spirit of the people prevailed over the loss
  of independence, and the more skilled workmen were encouraged by
  their new masters, who, recognising the beauty of the Persian
  carpets, sent many Persian artists to China and brought many
  Chinese artists to Persia, that the different races might derive
  advantages from the instruction of one another. It is therefore
  not surprising that from this time the influence of Chinese art
  has been recognised in the woven fabrics and metal work made in
  the southwestern part of Asia. In fact, the Chinese motive known
  as the &ldquo;key pattern,&rdquo; as well as other less familiar
  designs of distinctly Mongolian origin, appeared for the first
  time in some of the carpets and metal work of this period.</p>

  <p>Like Turkestan, Asia Minor has been one of the great
  battle-grounds of the world. During parts of the XI, XII, and
  XIII Centuries not only Seljukian Turks, but Mongols and Ottoman
  Turks under Murad and Bajazet, rose in influence until all Asia
  Minor, as well as Thrace and Macedonia, was subject to them. But
  still another power from the far East was to overrun Asia and
  divert Bajazet from the walls of Constantinople.</p>

  <p>Under Tamerlane, the descendant of Genghis Khan, the Mongol
  hordes were again united and again attempted the conquest of the
  world. From the walls of China to the Mediterranean Sea, and from
  the Steppes of Turkestan to the Arabian deserts, his victorious
  armies overcame all opposition. Never was conqueror more
  rapacious, more bloodthirsty. At Ispahan, seventy thousand
  inhabitants were slain. Georgia was laid waste and the people
  were massacred. In 1401, Bagdad was besieged and, when taken, a
  pyramid of ninety thousand human victims was raised as a monument
  to the Tartar conqueror. In the following year, when the armies
  of Bajazet and Tamerlane met on the plains near Angora, the Turks
  were defeated and Bajazet was captured. But now the tide of
  Mongol invasion receded; and laden with spoils Tamerlane returned
  to his capital at Samarkand, where he enjoyed the remaining years
  of his life by surrounding himself with a brilliant court
  and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id=
  "Page_28">28</a></span> by building palaces and temples, which he
  adorned with royal splendour. With all his atrocious barbarities
  he had a higher appreciation of art than his Mongolian
  predecessors. At his capital were assembled skilled artisans from
  Eastern and Western Asia; and there at the beginning of the XIV
  Century European travellers saw innumerable art treasures,
  including carpets of wonderful workmanship and beauty.</p>

  <p>The Mongol power also gained an important foothold in India.
  This country, like Iran, had been subjugated by a branch of the
  Aryan race, which conquered the native Dravidians, and remained
  dominant until the VII and VIII Centuries. Then the Mohammedans
  invaded it, and were still in ascendency when Tamerlane crossed
  the mountains and attacked Delhi. After the lapse of more than a
  hundred years his descendants, Baber, Akbar, and Shah Jahan, rose
  to power. The magnificence of their courts and the splendour of
  the temples which they built stimulated Indian art; and under the
  instruction of Persian artisans, who were induced to settle in
  that country, the natives attained their highest skill in
  weaving.</p>

  <p>With the death of Tamerlane, in 1405, the Ottoman power in
  Persia and Asia Minor rose again, and Turkish victories followed
  in quick succession until in 1453 Constantinople fell and the
  church of St. Sophia became a mosque.</p>

  <p>After the lapse of half a century Shah Ismael of the family of
  the Safavids defeated the Turkomans in 1502, and founded a new
  dynasty in Persia. With his rise began one of the most splendid
  periods in its history. Within a few years victories extended his
  empire from the Euphrates river to Afghanistan and from the Oxus
  to the Persian gulf. This was the land of ancient Iran, over
  which from his court at Ardebil he ruled until his death. In the
  early part of the reign of Shah Tamasp, which lasted from 1524 to
  1576, the new dynasty was threatened by the Turkish ruler,
  Soliman the Magnificent, after he had taken Rhodes from the
  Knights of St. John and invaded Southern Europe. In 1534 he
  captured Bagdad and Tabriz, as well as conquered Shirvan and
  Georgia.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> But the lost territory was
  soon regained and the new Persian capital was established at
  Tabriz where, as will be seen later, were woven many of the
  greatest masterpieces of Persian textile fabrics. Much as these
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id=
  "Page_29">29</a></span>monarchs had accomplished, it was Shah
  Abbas the Great who, after ten years of internal strife,
  succeeded by expelling the Turks from Persia, restoring
  tranquillity, and establishing commerce, in elevating his country
  from one of devastation and confusion to one of greatness such as
  it had not known for many ages. He transferred his court to
  Ispahan, where, while adding to the magnificence of the city, he
  encouraged art even to the extent of sending to Italy, for study,
  a number of the most skilled artists of Persia. These in time
  returned and exerted an influence that appeared in the more
  elaborate designs of carpets of a subsequent period. It is also
  probable that he rendered valuable assistance to Akbar of India
  in founding carpet-weaving in that country. He ruled from 1586 to
  1628. This period, during which America was a wilderness and
  England under Queen Elizabeth was still struggling with the
  feudal system, was the golden age of Persian history and Persian
  art; but with his death the Safavid dynasty declined and art
  decadence began.</p>

  <p>In 1722, the Afghans conquered Persia and for a number of
  years ruled it with horrible cruelty; but they were finally
  defeated by Nadir Shah, who captured Herat in 1731, extended his
  dominion into Georgia, and recovered some of the lost territory
  from the Turkish Empire in the West. After his death the
  sovereignty of Persia again waned, until in time it was confined
  to its present limits.</p>

  <p>It thus appears that from the earliest times recorded in
  history the southwestern part of Asia has been subject to
  invasion, and to constant struggles between the different races
  of the East for supremacy. Even from the desert of Gobi, the
  flanks of the Altai Mountains, and the deserts of Arabia have
  poured forth armies to devastate the land. One victorious power
  after another has extended its sway from the banks of the Indus
  to the shores of the Mediterranean. The result is that the
  present Oriental textile art is of a composite character, which
  can be understood only by taking into consideration the value of
  these racial influences that have contributed to it some of its
  most interesting and subtle charms.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

  <h4>THE MATERIALS</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/a.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="A"
  title="A" /></span>S was the case with the earliest shepherd
  weavers, many nomads living in unfrequented parts of Asia spin
  the wool taken from their own flocks, then colour it with dyes
  brewed from roots and herbs that they have personally gathered,
  and finally weave it according to well-known patterns into
  fabrics. But in large, enlightened communities the manufacture of
  an Oriental rug involves a division of labour. From the shepherds
  the professional dyers obtain the wool, which, after colouring,
  they sell to weavers; and these in turn often receive their
  patterns from others. A knowledge of these separate steps
  involving the industries of producing the different materials and
  the crafts of dyeing, weaving, and designing is essential to a
  full understanding of any Oriental woven fabric.</p>

  <p>The materials that were formerly used in weaving were
  generally of animal origin, such as the wool of sheep, goats, and
  camels. To a more limited extent silk and cotton also were used,
  and occasionally hair of the yak, cow, and even human hair. In
  later years, when there arose a western demand for eastern
  fabrics so that the aim of the weaver was to produce an article
  as cheaply as possible, flax, hemp, jute, and larger quantities
  of cotton were sometimes substituted. Since all of these
  materials are indigenous to the country where they are used, and
  are affected by its climate, altitude, humidity, and fertility,
  they acquire qualities that frequently give to rugs a distinctly
  local character.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 3. Kirman
    Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>The wool of sheep constitutes the warp and weft of at least
  half the Oriental rugs and the pile of over ninety per cent. To
  be sure, in Japan the pile is largely jute and cotton; in a few
  of the districts of Asia Minor and Persia it is mercerised cotton
  or silk; and in districts where the camel is still a beast of
  burden its wool and fine hair are often substituted for other
  kinds; but throughout all the rug-weaving <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>countries
  of the East the wool of the sheep has been and still is preferred
  to all other materials for the pile of rugs. This is due not
  alone to its warmth, to the facility with which it can be spun
  and twisted into knots, but also to the fact that from the
  remotest times the inhabitants of these districts, like Abraham
  of old, have been shepherds, who followed their calling because
  over the steppes of Tartary and the great plateaus that extend
  through Asia Minor, Persia, Afghanistan, and Turkestan spread
  vast pasture lands that seem better suited than any other parts
  of the world for the nourishment of sheep with fine fleeces. In
  fact, a part of these districts seems to be the natural habitat
  of the sheep; for among the crags of some of the lofty mountain
  chains of Central Asia, and farther west where Eastern and
  Western Turkestan meet in the lofty plateau of Pamir, called the
  &ldquo;Roof of the World,&rdquo; still wander great bands of
  magnificent native sheep with enormous horns and brownish grey
  wool, from which it is believed sprang the vast flocks that now
  browse on every hill and mountain slope of Western Asia.</p>

  <p>Centuries of care have effected an important evolution in this
  native stock, for in no other part of the world are there sheep
  with longer and more silky fleeces. Nevertheless there are
  different grades, as the quality depends in a measure on the
  climate and pasturage as well as on the care of the sheep. Thus
  in the hot, sandy lands the wool shows some deterioration; but in
  the cold, dry climates of the many high lands of Western Asia and
  in the pastures of particular localities the wool is long, fine,
  and lustrous. For instance, in parts of Khorassan, on the flanks
  of high mountains near Kirman and Shiraz, on the shores of Lake
  Niris in Farsistan, among the rolling uplands of Asia Minor, are
  produced uncommonly fine and beautiful fleeces. When, moreover,
  the sheep of these localities receive the care that is given by
  some of the nomadic tribes, as the Uzbeck Tartars, who not only
  shelter them but cover them with blankets, the wool acquires a
  soft and silky quality that is unsurpassed. The wool produced in
  many parts of India, on the other hand, is poor; for not only are
  the serrations, on which largely depends its value for textile
  purposes, less numerous than in better varieties, but it is harsh
  and contains many long hairs that do not well unite with it and
  that take up very little dye.</p>

  <p>The wool of the goat is much less extensively used, yet
  appears in some rugs, not only as warp and weft, but also as
  pile. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id=
  "Page_32">32</a></span> goats of Kashmir, which live in the cold
  climate of a table-land three miles above the ocean level,
  produce the finest and most beautiful wool; but as it grows near
  the skin, and beneath wiry hairs from which it can be removed
  only with tedious care, it is too precious to be used excepting
  for the most beautiful shawls and choicest carpets. Of next
  importance and finest texture is the wool of the Angora goat,
  known to commerce as mohair. Formerly there was not much demand
  for it, but now, on account of the consideration that it has
  received in the carpet factories of recent Sultans, it is found
  in many of the rugs of Asia Minor. As it grows to an average
  length of five to six inches it is easily spun; and its soft,
  lustrous sheen gives to the rugs in which it is used a silky and
  brilliant appearance. Some of the Bokhara goats, also, yield fine
  wool that is used in rugs. Yet, as a rule, yarn made from the
  fleece of the goat is not regarded with favour by weavers, since
  it is apt to be coarse and to pack closely. Nor does the wool of
  the goat mix well with the wool of the sheep. There is, however,
  a much finer grade growing next to the skin, which may be removed
  with a knife when it is exposed by combing the longer fleece in a
  direction reverse to that in which it lies. The tougher grades
  are preferred to any other material by weavers of the
  Afghanistan, Beluchistan, and some Turkoman rugs for selvages at
  the sides, as they afford excellent protection against hard
  usage. Goat&rsquo;s hair is also sometimes used in these rugs for
  warp. Unless mixed with wool it is very rarely used for weft, as
  it is not sufficiently pliable.</p>

  <p>Of more frequent use than the wool of the goat is the wool of
  the camel which grows close to the skin beneath the long hair. In
  the tropical countries, as in Soudan, the camel has no wool, but
  in more northern latitudes it yields a crop which increases in
  quantity and improves in quality as the climate grows colder.
  Thus in Arabia, Asia Minor, and in most of Persia and Turkestan
  the yield is small, in the table-lands of Eastern Persia and
  Afghanistan it is much larger, and on the lofty plateaus of
  Turkestan and Chinese Tartary as much as ten pounds of wool is
  obtained yearly from each beast. The clip is taken at the usual
  moulting season during the spring of the year. The wool of the
  older camels is coarse and dark, what is taken from the young is
  finer and lighter, and the most silky and valuable of all is what
  is obtained from the unborn. The best grade has been more highly
  esteemed than the wool of any other animal, and rugs in which it
  constitutes the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id=
  "Page_33">33</a></span> pile are more valuable than those in
  which the wool of sheep is used. It is seldom woven in modern
  rugs, but dyed wool or goats&rsquo; hair of similar colour is
  often substituted for it.</p>

  <p>The wool or underhair of the yak is used only among the
  mountain tribes of Tartary, and is never found in any of the
  choicer grades of rugs. Occasionally the hair of the horse or cow
  is employed to a limited extent in the pile of nomadic rugs,
  where it may be distinguished by its coarse and wiry character.
  In old rugs of which the pile is much worn cows&rsquo; hair will
  now and then protrude like the hairs of small bristle brushes.
  Only very rarely is human hair seen in a rug.</p>

  <p>Natural colours of the several kinds of wool, which have made
  it possible to dispense with their dyeing, have always been taken
  advantage of by weavers. The only black yarn on which the wear of
  time has left no impress is from the fleece of the proverbially
  despised black sheep. Shades of white, ivory, brown, grey, rufus,
  and even a plum are obtained from different varieties. Likewise a
  wide range of rich chestnut colours are furnished by the
  camel.</p>

  <p>It is but natural that the nomad should depend on the wool of
  his flocks and herds for warp, weft, and pile; but people of
  fixed habitations have employed other kinds of material also.
  Where the sensuous luxury of the East called for magnificent
  carpets, they were often woven almost entirely of silk, which was
  easily obtained, as silkworms thrive on the mulberry trees that
  grow wild on the plains of Central and Southwestern Asia. Silk
  rugs are still woven in a few cities of Asia Minor and Persia.
  For the cheaper grades of rugs flax, hemp, and jute have been
  sparingly used; and during recent years cotton has been widely
  adopted, particularly in Persian, Indian, and Chinese rugs, on
  account of its cheapness as compared with wool. It is, however,
  almost entirely as warp and weft and rarely as pile that it is
  used. Though much less durable than wool, its white colour is far
  less likely to darken with age; yet there is a poorer variety
  which, after being thoroughly wet, acquires a dark colour.</p>

  <p>In the preparation of these different textile materials wool
  requires the greatest care. In some parts of the Orient it is not
  washed, and the lustrous hues of the pile are attributed to the
  fact that it is dyed in its naturally greasy state; but in other
  parts the grease and dirt are carefully removed. This cleansing
  is a craft that has been transmitted from parent to child, and is
  practised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id=
  "Page_34">34</a></span> according to different methods in
  different parts of the country. One of the chief essentials is an
  abundance of clear running water free from alkali; for when the
  water is hard, as is often the case in the more arid parts of the
  country, it loses some of its cleansing properties, and potash or
  other chemicals are required to counter-act this unfavourable
  quality. After the wool has been thoroughly washed it is
  carefully dried in the sun and open air.</p>

  <p>The next important step is the proper sorting, picking, and
  combing. The sorting consists of the separation of black and
  light wool, or of an inferior from a better grade; and the
  picking consists of the removal of burrs or foreign particles.
  The object of combing is to effect an orderly arrangement of the
  wool so that it is ready for spinning. One method, corresponding
  to carding, is to draw the wool repeatedly between rows of
  upright spikes set in a wooden frame until every matted particle
  has been separated and all the fibres are disentangled. The older
  method, still employed in nearly every part of the Orient,
  consists of &ldquo;teasing&rdquo; with the cord of a heavy bow,
  which is suspended or held firmly by the left hand over the wool,
  while with the right hand the cord is made to vibrate either by
  striking it with a wooden instrument or plucking it, so that the
  fibres of wool are separated and assorted by the vibrations.</p>

  <p>When the wool has thus been prepared, it is wound about the
  distaff and then spun into yarn. In many parts of the Orient the
  common spinning-wheel has been introduced and adopted for both
  wool and cotton; in other parts are crudely made spinning-wheels
  of different design and about the height of a man. The natives of
  districts more remote from civilisation still cling to the
  primeval spindle, which sometimes consists of no more than a
  rounded stick half an inch in diameter and a foot in length with
  a ball of clay at one end. Many of the nomadic tribes of Asia
  Minor and Mesopotamia use in place of it a small stone of
  convenient shape, to which is tied a strip of linen a few inches
  in length. A few fibres of wool are attached to the end of the
  linen by twisting them about it, and a few more fibres are
  similarly attached to these when the stone is suspended and
  twirled. As the fibres become closely twisted together more
  fibres are added until on account of the length of the thread
  thus formed the stone reaches the ground. The thread is then
  wound about the stone and secured by a couple of loops so as to
  leave a piece only a few inches in length, to which more wool is
  attached in continuing the spinning. When a large ball of thread
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id=
  "Page_35">35</a></span>has been spun, it is removed from the
  stone and the process begun again.</p>

    Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>One advantage of these simple devices is that they can easily
  be carried anywhere. Even to-day a not unusual sight is a half
  barbaric shepherd following his flock, while he spins with simple
  distaff and spindle or stone, as did his ancestors thousands of
  years ago. On the end of the distaff, that rests beneath his left
  arm, is the ball of wool from which he selects and twists the
  fibres, while he deftly turns the short spindle or twirls the
  stone with thumb and forefinger of the right hand. The threads
  spun by professional spinners on spinning-wheels are of small
  diameter and are the most regular in size and texture, those spun
  with the small spindle are of larger diameter and less regular,
  and those spun by twirling a stone are made of the coarsest
  diameter in order to insure sufficient stoutness, since they are
  the most irregular in size and texture; yet yarn so made is the
  most highly valued by all weavers.</p>

  <p>Only very rarely, indeed, is one of these single threads used
  for yarn, since it would be apt to part. Two of them, therefore,
  are twisted together to form a double thread. A simple device
  used by many nomadic tribes for this purpose consists of two
  short sticks crossing at right angles, and another piece with end
  like a crochet needle perpendicular to them. The threads which
  are attached to this piece pass through a hole at the
  intersection of the crossed sticks and are twisted by twirling
  them. It is very seldom that three single threads are twisted to
  make a triple thread, and when such is the case it is the work of
  a professional spinner who uses a large spinning-wheel, and never
  the work of a nomad. For the weft of many rugs, and for the pile
  of a few rugs such as Sarouks and Kashans, a double thread alone
  is used; whilst for the pile of most rugs the double thread is
  again doubled, trebled, or quadrupled, so as to form yarn of two,
  three, or four ply, and even yarn of six ply is sometimes used. A
  distinction also exists in the manner of twisting together double
  threads to make yarn of two or more ply, since according to the
  custom of different tribes they may be twisted so loosely that in
  the length of an inch they do not describe more than a single
  revolution or so tightly as to describe several.</p>

  <p>Until the introduction of the modern spinning-wheel wool was
  spun in the Orient exactly as it was ages ago. It is this almost
  incredible disposition to adhere as with religious fanaticism to
  methods transmitted from father to son and to resist as
  pernicious <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id=
  "Page_36">36</a></span> every attempt at innovation that makes a
  precise analysis of rugs possible. Accordingly, the evenness or
  unevenness of single threads, the looseness or tightness with
  which double threads are twisted together to form yarn of
  different ply, as well as the number of the ply used, are a few
  of the important indices for distinguishing between rugs of
  different districts.</p>

  <p>Even after the yarn is spun it is not always ready for the
  dyer, and in order that it may properly absorb the dye it is
  often washed and rewashed. In some parts of the Orient it is
  first soaked in warm water and carefully rinsed in cold water. It
  is then placed in a copper pot or vat containing boiling water to
  which has been added carbonate or sulphate of soda and potash,
  and stirred for about an hour. After this thorough cleansing it
  is again washed very carefully in soft water and thoroughly dried
  in the sun.</p>

  <p>The wonderful sheen of many old rugs is due almost entirely to
  the materials of which they are made. This material, as a rule,
  is unsurpassed by similar products of any other part of the
  world, and is prepared by patient races who know little of the
  value of time. The simple labour required is in itself prosaic
  enough, yet without a doubt the earlier spinners and weavers,
  while following their flocks with minds free from all conventions
  and limitations of art, discerned the elemental forces of nature
  in all their freshness and power, and from them drew inspiration
  that bore fruit in the exquisite colouring and delicate tracery
  of the woven carpets.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

  <h4>DYEING</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/h.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="H"
  title="H" /></span>OWEVER remarkable the achievements of Oriental
  art in any field, their most pleasing effect has always been
  associated with colour. Without it the beauty of the lustre tiles
  of Persia, the marvellous porcelains of China, and the delicate
  textiles of Western Asia would fade into insignificance. It is
  indeed the wonderful harmonies of exquisite tints chosen by the
  touch of genius from a palette of many thousand pigments that
  awaken the appreciation of the luxurious splendour of the East.
  This love for colour is inherent in every rug-producing race of
  Asia and is older than history. It is but natural, then, that the
  earliest carpets should be radiant with glorious tints, which in
  a lesser measure are reflected in modern fabrics.</p>

  <p>If high praise is due to the artist who, by a skilful
  association of different colours of co-ordinate tones, creates
  the picture that delights the sense, a fair measure is also due
  to the artisan who not only controls the secrets of the dyes, but
  has mastered the difficult knowledge of their proper application;
  for the beauty of the finished woven product depends on the
  judicious dyeing of the yarn more than on anything else. From
  father to son for many generations has been transmitted a
  knowledge of those particular vegetable and animal products of
  root, leaf, fruit, and insect, and the manner of their use, by
  which the imperishable lustrous sheen and colour of the finest
  woven fabrics are produced. Indeed, this art requires to-day more
  technical knowledge than any other branch of rug weaving, since
  modern designs are no longer more than the imitation of those in
  older carpets; and so important is it regarded that a successful
  dyer is a man of distinction in his tribe.</p>

  <p>The sources from which are obtained many of the dyes that give
  the innumerable carpet colours are recorded. A few of them are
  received from remote countries, but most of the plants from
  which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id=
  "Page_38">38</a></span> they are extracted grow in marshes and on
  hills and plains where the nomads wander with their flocks. Many
  of them are used without blending, but even some of the seven
  primary colours are derived by proper blending; and from a number
  of dyes of different strengths and qualities are produced an
  infinite number of rich and delicate shades.</p>

  <p>The principal blues of Oriental rugs are obtained from indigo.
  This is derived from colouring matter in the leaves of plants of
  the genus <i>Indigofera</i>, that grow to a height of four to six
  feet in the East Indies, when they are cut and placed in a vat
  containing water. In about twelve hours fermentation ensues; and
  after this subsides the liquid is drawn off into another vat,
  where after one or two hours of agitation the indigo forms as a
  precipitate. Many different species of this plant grow wild
  throughout Asia, and from the earliest times have been used to
  produce dye-stuff. Indigo is one of the most valuable of all
  dyes, as by using it in conjunction with others an infinite
  variety of shades result.</p>

  <p>Some reds are obtained from the plant madder (<i>Rubia
  tinctorum</i>), that grows abundantly in Central and Southwestern
  Asia, Its colouring properties were known to the ancients; and
  for a long period it has been cultivated in Asia Minor, where the
  succulent roots of the second and third years&rsquo; growth are
  regularly dried and prepared for use. Other reds are derived from
  the insect cochineal (<i>Coccus ilicis</i>) that lives on oaks of
  the countries bordering the Mediterranean, and was known among
  the Arabs as &ldquo;kermes,&rdquo; signifying Red Dye. After the
  discovery of America another species (<i>Coccus cacti</i>) was
  found that was more productive of dyeing qualities. The females,
  which alone are valuable, are plucked from the trees and killed
  by exposing them to vapours of acetic acid, or placing them in
  hot water, or in an oven. From their dried bodies, of which over
  fifty thousand are necessary to make a pound, the dye is
  produced. As both these dyes are noted for their fastness, they
  are constantly used, but when silk or wool is to be dyed
  cochineal is preferable to madder.</p>

  <p>The yellow dyes are obtained from several sources. Some are
  from the berries of plants of Western Asia. Others are from the
  leaves of the sumach bushes, that are indigenous to nearly every
  part of the world. An orange tinge is derived from the turmeric
  extracted from the short root stocks of a plant of the genus
  <i>Curcuma</i>. From time immemorial a beautiful yellow has been
  obtained from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id=
  "Page_39">39</a></span> saffron. It is the product of the stigmas
  of the fragrant crocus, which are so small that over four
  thousand are necessary to furnish an ounce of dried saffron; yet
  the dye is so powerful that it will give a distinct tint to seven
  hundred thousand times its weight of water. As saffron has
  something of a stimulating effect on the human system, it has
  been taken by the Persians when mixed with their rice.</p>

  <p>With none of these three basic colours was any national
  feeling associated, yet the Persians excelled in the use of
  blues. The Turkomans of Turkestan and Asia Minor produced better
  reds than any other colour, and the best yellows, even if
  generally inferior in positiveness to blues and reds, were those
  of the Chinese.</p>

  <p>Though other primary and secondary colours sometimes result
  from the application of a single dye, the many thousand different
  tints can only be produced by the blending of two or more.
  Moreover, the qualities of the same dye vary greatly, as they
  depend on the soil where the plant grew, the time of year when it
  was removed, and the weather and other conditions prevailing
  during the dyeing.</p>

  <p>In nature green is one of the most pleasing colours, but in
  carpets it is most unsatisfactory, as it has generally a faded
  appearance, due probably to the fact that one of the dyes of
  which it is formed by blending is less permanent than the other.
  The Chinese greens obtained from the buckthorns are generally the
  best.</p>

  <p>Greys and browns are sometimes derived from gall nuts, and
  reddish brown from henna. For very dark browns and black, iron
  pyrites has been largely used in both old and modern rugs; but
  unfortunately the dye has a corrosive effect on the wool, so that
  the black knots of old rugs are often worn to the warp.</p>

  <p>In parts of India flowers of the bastard teak (<i>Butea
  frondosa</i>) make a favourite dye, from which are produced, by
  blending with other dyes, a large number of shades ranging from
  deep yellow to brownish copper tones. Another well known dye is
  <i>Butti lac</i>, obtained from an insect, <i>Coccus lacca</i>,
  that lives on the twigs of trees. It is a substitute for
  cochineal and produces different shades of red, crimson, terra
  cotta, and purple, according to the other dyes and the mordants
  with which it is blended.</p>

  <p>Besides these few dyes are innumerable others that are used
  either singly or in combination. Furthermore, different colour
  effects are produced by the application of different mordants,
  which it is necessary to use for the reason that without them
  many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id=
  "Page_40">40</a></span> fibrous materials are unable to absorb a
  large number of the dyes. The most valuable of all mordants is
  alum; and the sulphate of iron and tin are largely employed in
  the case of red colours. Of the vegetable mordants, pomegranate
  rind, which contains some yellow colouring matter, is the best
  known. Valonia also is sometimes used, as well as limes, lemons,
  the fruit of the tamarind, and the mango.</p>

  <p>In the monograph of Mr. Harris on the &ldquo;Carpet Weaving
  Industry of Southern India&rdquo; are a number of directions from
  an old manuscript owned by a dyer who stated that he was the
  descendant of twenty generations of dyers who originally came
  from Tabriz, and that he had made his copy from a Persian book of
  dyes which had belonged to his grandfather. A few of these are
  given below, because they show not only the dyes and mordants,
  but also the methods employed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Birbuls Blue. Take cinnabar, indigo, and alum, grind
  and sift lighter than the light dust of the high hills; soak for
  ten hours; keep stirring it; put in the wool and soak for many
  hours. Boil for three hours; wash in kurd water, water in which
  kurds and whey have been well beaten up; leave for three hours,
  and then wash and beat again in water.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A Fine Indigo Blue. Take indigo, soak it in water for
  twelve hours, grind it to a fine paste in a mortar, add some
  <i>Terminalia citrina</i>, pomegranate peel, and alum; and mix
  thoroughly. Boil; put the water into the hot bath and keep
  stirring till cold. Now mix in some iron-filings water, and boil
  steadily for another two and a half to three hours; wash with a
  beating and dry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ruddy Brown Grey. Take sulphate of iron, <i>Terminalia
  citrina</i>, oak galls, and alum; mix well; dry; then steep for
  twenty-four hours. Put in the wool; soak it for twenty-four
  hours, then boil for two or three hours. Dip in a soda-bath,
  wash, and dry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cinnamon. Take oak galls, acacia bark, cinnabar, and
  alum, and steep for a night. Put in the wool, and soak for twenty
  or thirty hours; boil the water for two or three hours and give a
  soda-bath wash; dip in acidulated water; and wash again with
  beating.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Crimson. Take lac colour and cochineal. Steep for from
  four to six days in the sun, in hot weather for the lesser time,
  stirring constantly till a rich deep colour comes where some has
  stood for a few minutes in a thin glass bottle and settled. Then
  strain through two cloths, and put in pomegranate rind and good
  iron-filings water. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id=
  "Page_41">41</a></span>Add mineral acid; steep wool for
  thirty-six hours, then boil for three hours, wash well, and
  dry.</p>

  <h4><i>COLOUR PLATE II&mdash;OUSHAK CARPET</i></h4>

  <p><i>The colours and pattern of this antique Oushak are similar
  to those of the best examples that remain of the carpets woven in
  Asia Minor during the XV and XVI Centuries. The deep blue of the
  central field, the rich red of the medallions, and the golden
  yellow of the leaves are entirely unlike the more subdued hues
  found in Persian rugs. Strongly contrasting with them are the
  more delicate tones of the tendrils and leaves, which display in
  their drawing a keen sense of refinement. In the formal pattern
  of the field are stateliness and elegance; in the narrow borders
  are simplicity and grace. Such colours and drawing show that the
  early Asia Minor weavers had an intense appreciation of the
  ennobling qualities of beauty and harmony.</i></p>

  </div>

  <p>&ldquo;Pale Greyish Green. Take copper rust, asburg,<a name=
  "FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class=
  "fnanchor">5</a> and alum. Mix well with any hot water, not
  boiling; soak wool for eighteen hours, then boil for three hours.
  Give a bath with water acidulated with some limes, and dry in
  shade.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Old Gold and Rich Yellow. Take turmeric and asburg,
  cinnabar and alum. Soak all night. Steep wool for twenty-four
  hours, boil for four and a half hours, wash with a beating, and
  dry in shade.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dark Grey. Take of the fruit of <i>Cupressus
  sempervirens</i>, seeds and seed pods of babul (<i>Acacia
  arabica</i>), iron-filings water, and alum. Steep over night. Now
  add the water and let it soak for twenty-four hours, then boil
  for two or three hours, until the colour is right, then wash and
  dry in the sun.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rose Colour. Take ratanjot (<i>Onosma echioides</i>), a
  thought of cochineal, manjit (<i>Rubia cordifolia</i>) or lac
  colour a very little, and cinnabar. Add water, soak them for
  twelve hours, put in wool, and steep for thirty-six hours; cook
  it for three hours, then bathe the wool in alum and wash nicely;
  afterward dry in the shade.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Persian Scarlet. Take lac colour, and if you choose a
  little cochineal for richness, and soak from four to six days;
  strain it in two cloths and add alum and a little turmeric; let
  it stand for three hours. Put wool in and steep for twenty-four
  hours, then boil for two hours. Take out the wool and add mineral
  acid; re-enter wool and boil an hour more. Wash fifteen minutes
  when cold, and dry in the shade.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Saffron Yellow. Take turmeric, cinnabar, and soda, add
  water and keep for a full day. Then add some alum, make the dip,
  and soak the wool for thirty hours. Cook it for several hours,
  and dry in the shade after beating and good washing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rich Yellow. Take asburg and turmeric, soak for a night
  in water, steep the wool for twenty-four hours, add alum, shake
  out, and dry in shade.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Identical shades of a number of colours are not produced in
  all parts of the Orient, not only for the reason that soil,
  moisture, and climate affect the colour values of dye-stuff, but
  because each family of dyers preserve inviolable the craft
  secrets transmitted from their forefathers. Thus it happens that
  different parts of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42"
  id="Page_42">42</a></span>rug-producing countries adhere to
  particular tones that help to identify the locality where the
  fabrics were woven.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately the Western aniline dyes, which were introduced
  about the year 1860 and quickly adopted because they are cheaper
  and less complicated in their application, have to such an extent
  transplanted some of these fine old vegetable dyes that a number
  of the richest and most delicate colours found in the rugs of a
  former century are no longer produced. Thus the superb blue of
  the fine old Ispahans, as well as of lustre tiles and illuminated
  manuscripts, belongs to a lost art. The disadvantages of the
  aniline dyes are several: they have a tendency to make the fibres
  of the textile fabric brittle, and when it is wet the colours
  will frequently run. Some dyes also fade more readily than
  others, so that if a colour be the product of two or more dyes,
  the resultant tint may be totally unlike the original. On the
  other hand, not all vegetable dyes are fast; but as they fade
  they mellow into more pleasing shades. Efforts have been made to
  encourage the use of old vegetable dyes; but unless the laws
  which have been enacted in parts of Asia to restrict the
  importation of aniline dyes be more stringently enforced than in
  the past, the cultivation in the garden patch of the
  dye-producing herbs and plants will soon cease to be the
  time-honoured occupation it was in days gone by.</p>

  <p>Almost as important as the art of preparing the dyes is that
  of properly applying them to the yarns. It is an art that demands
  infinite pains in its technique, as well as a lifetime to
  acquire. It is in itself a separate profession practised by
  artisans who guard with jealousy the sacred secrets that
  transmitted from generation to generation occupy their thoughts
  to the exclusion of almost everything else. The homes of these
  professional dyers in the larger villages and cities are located
  on a stream of water which possesses mineral properties that long
  experience has proven especially suitable as solvents for the
  different kinds of colouring matter. Ranged about the walls of
  their low dwellings are jars or vats containing liquid dye of
  various colours. Suspended above them, from hooks driven into
  beams, are the yarns from which, after immersion in the proper
  vats, the liquids are allowed to drain. After this the yarns are
  exposed for the proper length of time to the dry air and burning
  sun. It is, therefore, the suitable mordants, the preparation of
  the proper dyes for the vats, the immersion of the yarn in
  correct sequence and for the correct length of time, as well
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id=
  "Page_43">43</a></span>as the exposure to the glare and heat of
  the sun for a definite period to be gauged to the exact moment,
  on which the colour results depend. This complicated process by
  which, for instance, the infinitely different shades of a red, a
  blue, or a brown may be conveyed to yarn by using the same dyes
  but by slightly modifying the steps requires the greatest
  precision, for which no rule but an experience amounting almost
  to instinct is the guide.</p>

  <p>There was a time when the Oriental had not learned the meaning
  of <i>tempus fugit</i> or seen the glitter of Western gold, when
  his dyeing and weaving were proud callings, in which entered his
  deepest feelings. Then the old vegetable dyes that mellow, grow
  softer and more lustrous, were almost exclusively used; but now
  throughout all weaving countries the dyer has deteriorated so
  that he can no longer produce some of the rich colours in use
  half a century ago. Yet remote from the principal lines of
  travel, on the edges of the desert, in lonely valleys, among
  rugged mountains, half-tamed tribes are still dyeing their
  hand-spun yarn as did their fathers&rsquo; fathers.</p>

  <h4>WEAVING</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/n.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="N"
  title="N" /></span>EAR the tents of some nomadic tribes may
  occasionally be seen crude looms on which are woven some of the
  most interesting rugs that now reach the Western markets. In all
  probability they are not dissimilar to what were used thousands
  of years ago, for it would be impossible to construct a simpler
  loom. Where two trees suitably branching are found growing a few
  feet apart, all of the upper branches are removed excepting two,
  which are so trimmed as to leave a crotch at the same height in
  each tree. In each crotch is rested the end of a pole or beam,
  and parallel to it is placed another extending at a short
  distance above the ground from trunk to trunk. Or, as is more
  frequently the case, roughly hewn posts are firmly implanted in
  the ground and horizontal beams are stretched between them. In
  the upper one is a groove with a rod to which one end of the
  warp, consisting of strong threads of yarn numbering from ten to
  thirty to the inch, is attached, while the other end is tightly
  stretched and firmly secured to the lower horizontal beam.
  Sometimes the beams to which the warp is attached are placed
  perpendicularly, so that the weaver may stand and move sideways
  as the work progresses. But among a very large number of those
  tribes that are constantly wandering in search of new pastures
  for their flocks and herds, it is customary to let the loom lie
  flat on the ground, while the weaver sits on the finished part of
  the rug.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate A.&mdash;An Upright
    Loom.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>Under more favourable circumstances, when the tribes live in
  villages or cities, the looms are so made that the weavers are
  not compelled to bend in order to tie the first row of knots or
  stand erect to finish the last rows of a long rug. Of the several
  devices by which the weaver may remain seated while at work, the
  crudest consists of a plank used as a seat, which rests on the
  rungs of two ladders placed parallel to each other at the sides
  of the rug. As <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id=
  "Page_46">46</a></span>the work progresses, the plank is raised
  and rested upon the higher rungs. More frequently, however, both
  upper and lower beams of the frame have the shape of cylinders of
  small diameter, which revolve between the upright posts. The
  lower ends of the threads of warp are attached to the lower beam,
  and the other ends may either be wound several times around the
  upper one or else pass over it and be kept taut by weights
  attached to them. Such a loom is generally used for weaving very
  large rugs, which are rolled up on the lower beam as the work
  progresses.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pa">A</a> (Page 45) is represented a loom
  commonly used in many parts of the Orient. When preparing it for
  weaving two stakes are driven in the ground at a suitable
  distance apart, and about them the warp is wound in the way a
  figure eight is formed. The warp is then carefully transferred to
  two rods that are attached to the upper and lower beams. If it
  has been carefully wound, none of the threads should be slack;
  but if desired the tension may be further increased by different
  devices. Two other rods, known as &ldquo;Healds,&rdquo; are then
  attached to the front and back threads of warp; or in the case of
  a single rod, it is attached to the back threads, as shown in the
  Plate. A lease rod is next inserted between the threads of warp
  that cross below the upper beam, and another is placed below it
  where, if necessary, it is supported in position by loops. When
  the weaving begins, a short web is generally woven at the lower
  end to protect the knots from wear. After the first row has been
  tied, the shuttle carrying the thread of weft is passed between
  the front and back threads of warp; the heald rod attached to
  these back threads is then pulled forward, so that they are now
  in front of the others, and the shuttle is passed back. If the
  rug is narrow, only one shuttle is used; but if the rug is wide,
  or if the weft consists of two threads of unequal thickness, a
  shuttle is passed across from each side. Every thread of warp is
  in this way completely encircled by the thread of weft as it
  passes and repasses. When weaving large rugs, there is an
  advantage in having two heald rods, as by their use the distance
  between the front and back threads of warp may be increased. The
  object of the lease rod is to prevent any slack caused by drawing
  forward the threads of warp, and is accomplished in a very simple
  manner, as will be seen by studying the drawing; since when the
  tension of the back threads is increased by drawing them forward,
  the tension of the front threads is also increased by displacing
  the lease rods which thereby stretches them.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id=

  <p>The products of the loom are divided according to their weave
  into three separate classes. The simplest of these are the
  kilims, which are without pile and consist only of warp and weft
  to which a few embroidered stitches representing some symbol are
  occasionally added.</p>

  <p>A more elaborately made class are the Soumaks. They consist of
  warp covered by flat stitches of yarn and of a thread of weft
  which extends across and back between each row of stitches in the
  old rugs and between each second and third row of stitches in the
  new rugs. In the narrow, perpendicular lines that define both
  borders and designs the stitch is made by the yarn encircling two
  adjacent threads of warp; but in other parts of the rug it is
  made by the yarn passing across two adjacent threads of warp at
  the front, and after encircling them at the back, recrossing them
  again at the front. It is then continued across the next pair of
  adjacent threads of warp. The result is that at the back of these
  rugs each of the two threads of warp encircled by the yarn
  appears as a separate cord, while at the front the yarn passes
  diagonally across four threads of warp. As this diagonal movement
  is reversed in each succeeding row, the surface has an uneven
  appearance sometimes termed &ldquo;herring bone&rdquo; weave.</p>

  <p>By far the largest class of rugs are those with a pile. When
  making them, the weaver begins at the bottom and ties to each
  pair of adjacent threads of warp a knot of yarn so as to form a
  horizontal row. A thread of weft is then passed, as often as
  desired, between the threads of warp and pressed more or less
  firmly with a metal or wooden comb upon the knots, when they are
  trimmed with a knife to the desired length. Another horizontal
  row of knots is tied to the threads of warp; again the yarn of
  weft is inserted; and so the process continues until the pile is
  completed. In tying the knots, work almost invariably proceeds
  from left to right and from the bottom to the top. It is but
  rarely that the warp is stretched horizontally and that the knots
  are tied in rows parallel to the sides. It is still more
  infrequently that a rug is found in which the knots are tied by
  working from the centre to the right and left, and to the top and
  bottom. These interesting exceptions may easily be discovered by
  rubbing the hand over the pile, when it will be noticed that the
  knots lie on one another so as to face the same direction, which
  is the opposite to that in which the work of tying advanced, or
  as is generally the case, from top to bottom.</p>

  <p>The compactness, durability, and value of a rug depend
  somewhat <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id=
  "Page_48">48</a></span> on the number of knots in any particular
  area. Yet if the yarn is coarse, the rug may be compact even
  though the number of knots be small; and if the yarn is fine, the
  rug may be loosely woven, either because the rows of knots have
  not been firmly pressed down, or because there are several
  &ldquo;filling threads&rdquo; of weft, and still the number of
  knots be large. A square inch is a convenient size for
  measurement; but since all parts of a rug are not woven with
  equal compactness, the measurement should be made in several
  places if exactness be required. In loosely woven pieces, such as
  the Oushaks and some of the Genghas, there may be less than
  twenty knots to the square inch; but among the more closely
  woven, as the Kirmans and Bokharas, are frequently several
  hundred.</p>

  <p>These knots are of two classes, the Ghiordes and the Sehna.
  The Ghiordes are found in all rugs of Asia Minor and Caucasia, in
  some of the rugs of India, and in most of the rugs of Persia.
  They are named after the town of Ghiordes in Asia Minor, where
  some of the finest Asiatic pieces were made, and which tradition
  states was once the ancient Gordion, noted even in the days of
  Alexander. In tying the knot, the two ends of yarn appear
  together at the surface included between two<a name="FNanchor_6"
  id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
  adjacent threads of warp around which they have been passed, so
  that the tighter the yarn is drawn the more compact the knot
  becomes. The three different ways of tying this knot are shown in
  Plate <a href="#pb">B</a>, Figs. 1, 2, and 3 (Page 49), of which
  the second is known as a &ldquo;right hand&rdquo; and the third
  as a &ldquo;left hand&rdquo; knot. The Sehna knots, which are
  used in the Turkoman, Chinese, many of the Persian, and in some
  of the Indian rugs, take their name from the city of Sehna in
  Persia. In tying them, a piece of yarn encircles a thread of warp
  and is twisted so that its ends appear at the surface, one at
  each side of the adjacent thread of warp, as is shown in Plate
  <a href="#pb">B</a>, Figs. 4, 5, and 6. According as this thread
  of warp is to the right or the left of the one they encircle, the
  knots are known as &ldquo;right-hand&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;left-hand&rdquo; knots,<a name="FNanchor_7" id=
  "FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> but
  in the appearance of the carpet there is no distinction. If the
  pile of a rug is carefully parted, the two ends of yarn forming a
  Sehna knot can be separated; but with the Ghiordes knot this is
  impossible, as will be understood by studying Plate <a href=
  "#pb">B</a>, in which Figs. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 are Ghiordes
  knots, and Figs. 4, 5, 6, and 10 are Sehna knots. As a rule, the
  Sehna knots, which permit of closer weaving and clearer
  definition of pattern, appear in rugs of shorter nap.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id=
  "Page_50">50</a></span>The nice distinctions in the technique of
  weaving are rarely understood even by those who are familiar with
  Oriental rugs. The general pattern, which next to colour is the
  characteristic that most quickly arrests the attention, is often
  the sole guide by which novices guess the class. The more
  experienced will observe if the knot be Ghiordes or Sehna, and
  examine the finish at the sides and ends; but few give the
  peculiarities of the weave the consideration they deserve. This,
  perhaps, is because only those who have made a special study
  would believe the constancy with which members of a tribe or
  locality have followed the same method of tying the knot and
  inserting the weft. The different methods of treatment by
  separate tribes are sometimes only slight, but they afford a most
  important clue for determining the place of origin of doubtful
  classes. In fact, nearly every class has a typical weave
  differentiating it from all other classes. To be sure, there are
  exceptions to the established type which are inevitable; since,
  for instance, a man from the Feraghan district might marry a
  woman from the adjoining Hamadan district, who, to please her
  husband, might weave a rug with pattern common to his district
  but follow the style of weaving that she has been familiar with
  from childhood. Nevertheless, weavers of a particular district
  adhere more closely to a typical style of weaving than they do to
  any other characteristic of a rug. Nor is this surprising, since
  weaving is learned in earliest childhood; and as it contains no
  elements calculated to stimulate the imagination, it is
  mechanically followed with stereotyped precision. An innovation
  in pattern, by copying some strange designs that strike the
  fancy, is far more likely. These distinctions in weaving may be
  conveniently divided into those that affect the knot, the warp,
  and the weft.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The Knot.</span>&mdash;Not only may a knot
  be tied as a Ghiordes or a Sehna knot, but it may have other
  distinguishing peculiarities; as, for instance, it may be of fine
  or coarse wool. This is most conveniently observed at the back,
  where it will be seen that the knots of rugs such as the Bokhara,
  Kirman, Joshaghan, and Bergamo are tied with fine yarn; while the
  knots of other rugs, as the Samarkand, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span> Bijar,
  Gorevan, Kurdistan, Yuruk, and Kazak are tied with coarse yarn.
  Whether the yarn be fine, medium, or coarse, all specimens of any
  class will show a remarkable conformity. Also in some rugs the
  knots are drawn very tight against the warp, while in others the
  yarn encircles the warp loosely. Any one who has examined the
  back of many Sarouks, Kashans, Kirmans, or Daghestans, and rubbed
  the finger-nail against them, could not possibly mistake them for
  a Shiraz, Kulah, Yuruk, or Karabagh, which are less tightly
  woven. Again, as a result of using yarn in which the double
  thread that forms two or more ply has been very loosely or very
  tightly twisted together, there is some difference in the
  direction or slant of the strands forming the yarn, where it
  shows at the back, though this feature is not pronounced. For
  example, in most Afghans, Yuruks, Bijars, and others the strands
  of yarn where it crosses the warp in forming the knot lie for the
  most part in a direction parallel to the weft; while in other
  rugs, as Mosuls, Kurdistans, and Kazaks, the strands of yarn
  slant irregularly. Furthermore, in some rugs, as the Melez and
  Yuruks, as a result of the threads of yarn being strung rather
  far apart, each half of a knot encircling a thread of warp stands
  out at the back distinctly from the other with clear cut edges;
  while in many rugs, as the Shiraz or Sehna, each half is very
  closely pressed together. Also in some rugs, as Sarabends and
  Afshars, each of these half knots where they show at the back
  have the same length, measured in a direction parallel to the
  warp, as width, measured in a direction parallel to the weft;
  while in such rugs as the Kazaks, since the yarn generally
  consists of several ply, the length exceeds the width; and in a
  few rugs the length is less than the width.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The Warp.</span>&mdash;The appearance of
  the back of a rug is partly due to the relative positions of the
  two threads of warp encircled by a knot. If, for instance, in any
  Kazak a pin be thrust through the nap wherever a single
  perpendicular line of one colour appears at the surface, it will
  be seen that each of the two threads of warp encircled by a
  single knot lie side by side with equal prominence. This is shown
  in Plate <a href="#pb">B</a>, Figs. 7 and 7a (Page 49), in which
  the former represents a section of a rug cut transversely to the
  threads of warp, and the latter the appearance of the rug at the
  back. The same will be found true of Beluchistans, Feraghans,
  Yuruks, and many others. If, however, a Kulah, Persian-Kurdish,
  or Karabagh be similarly examined, it will be seen that one
  thread of warp to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id=
  "Page_52">52</a></span> each knot is depressed, so that the back
  has a slightly corrugated appearance (as in Plate <a href=
  "#pb">B</a>, Figs. 8 and 8a). And in the case of a Bijar or
  Sarouk it will be seen that one thread of warp, included in every
  knot, has been doubled under so as to be entirely concealed from
  view; with the result that the foundation of warp has a double
  thickness, which makes the rug much stronger, as in Plate
  <a href="#pb">B</a>, Fig. 9, representing a Ghiordes knot, and
  Fig. 10 representing a Sehna knot. To be sure, it occasionally
  happens that in rugs of a particular class some may have each
  thread of warp included in a knot equally prominent and others
  may have one slightly depressed; or that in rugs of another class
  some may have one thread of warp depressed and others may have it
  entirely concealed; but as a rule these tribal features show a
  remarkable constancy. These relative positions of the two threads
  of warp encircled by a knot are partly due to the degree of
  closeness with which the threads of warp are strung, also partly
  to the method of inserting the threads of weft or
  &ldquo;filling&rdquo; between the rows of knots; but more than
  all else they are due to the way one end of the knots is pulled
  when they are tied.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The Weft.</span>&mdash;In the character
  and arrangement of weft are technical differences that are more
  serviceable than any other feature for distinguishing between the
  rugs of different tribes and districts. So subtle are some of
  them that they can be learned only by long and painstaking study,
  and are appreciated by few except native weavers. Nevertheless,
  to any one who will carefully examine almost any well-known
  classes, it will be apparent that these differences in the weave
  are real, and that they are sufficiently constant to
  differentiate one class from another. The fine brown weft of the
  Bokhara, or equally fine bluish weft of a Sarouk that is almost
  concealed between firmly tied knots; the fine thread of cotton
  weft passing but once between two rows of knots and covered only
  by the transverse warp of the Sehna; the coarse thread of cotton
  weft similarly passing but once between two rows of knots in the
  Hamadan; the coarse thread of cotton weft that once crossing and
  recrossing appears irregularly between appressed rows of knots in
  Kermanshahs; the bead-like appearance of the threads of weft
  that, as a rule, pass many times between two rows of knots in
  Genghas; the crudely spun weft of coarse diameter crossing and
  recrossing once between the rows of knots in modern Mosuls; the
  very fine reddish brown weft that entirely conceals from view the
  warp in old Bergamos, &mdash;are features peculiar to these
  separate classes with which <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>every rug expert is familiar.
  The weft of many other classes is equally distinctive, though
  there are exceptions to the types. It should be remembered,
  however, that the weave of many rugs woven over a hundred and
  fifty years ago is different from the weave of rugs woven only
  fifty years ago; and that many modern pieces cheaply made for
  commercial purposes are more crudely woven than were the same
  classes thirty years ago.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 8. Hamadan
    Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>These distinctions in the weft relate to the material of which
  it is made, its colour, the size of the diameter, the way in
  which it is spun, to its loose or compressed condition between
  separate rows of knots, as well as to the number of times it
  crosses the warp between them, and to whether it is inserted with
  much or little slack. Most rugs are woven with woollen weft of a
  natural colour, but occasionally it has a reddish brown, a blue,
  or a yellow tint. When cotton, jute, or hemp are used, they are
  almost invariably of natural colour; only in a very few pieces,
  as some of the Kulahs, are both wool and jute ever used in the
  same piece. The weft of some classes, as Bokharas, Sarouks, and
  Bergamos, is of a very small diameter, and of others, as the
  Hamadans and Kurdistans, it is of relatively large diameter. In
  some classes, as the Karajes and Genghas, the weft is tightly
  spun like twine; while in the Beluchistans, Mosuls, and
  Kurdistans it is loosely spun, so that the projecting fibres of
  wool give a rough appearance to its surface.</p>

  <p>Also the weavers of some districts invariably compress very
  firmly the yarn of weft between every two rows of knots, while
  other weavers compress it only to a slight degree; as, for
  instance, in the Afghan, Tabriz, and Kirman the rows of knots are
  pressed down so firmly that the weft is almost concealed at the
  back and the transverse threads of warp are entirely covered;
  whilst, on the other hand, in the Karabagh or Kazak between every
  two rows of knots the weft and part of the transverse threads of
  warp are exposed to view. According as the rows of knots are
  pressed down upon the threads of weft or not, one of the two
  halves of each separate knot, as shown at the back, may extend
  slightly or very much beyond the other in the direction of the
  length of the rug, or each of them may lie in a straight line at
  right angles to the warp. Comparing Kazak, Kutais, and Tiflis
  rugs, for example, it will be noticed that as a rule the line
  thus formed in Tiflis rugs is nearly an even, clear cut line at
  right angles to the warp, that in the Kutais part of one knot
  extends beyond the other, while in Kazaks this unevenness is even
  more <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id=
  "Page_54">54</a></span> conspicuous. Or again, if typical
  Shirvans, Kabistans, and Daghestans be compared, it will be
  noticed that in Shirvans the half-knots, or parts of the knot
  encircling the two adjacent threads of warp, are often inclined
  at an angle of at least thirty degrees to the line of weft so as
  to present a serrated appearance, but that the alignment formed
  by knots of Daghestans is nearly even, and that of Kabistans is
  intermediate. To be sure, there are exceptions to this rule, but
  these features are remarkably constant.</p>

  <p>The number of times that a thread of weft is inserted between
  two rows of knots varies with the practice of different
  localities, but is almost constant in each locality. Weavers of
  Sehna rugs insert only a single thread of weft between every two
  rows of knots, which winds in front of and behind alternate
  threads of warp, with the result that the back of these rugs have
  a checkered or quincunx appearance, caused by minute portions of
  exposed warp and weft crossing each other at right angles. In
  Hamadans a much heavier thread of weft passes only once before
  and behind alternate threads of warp, so that the appearance of
  the weave is very similar to that of Sehnas.<a name="FNanchor_9"
  id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
  In almost all other rugs the weft crosses twice, that is, across
  and back once, between every two rows of knots so as to
  completely encircle each thread of warp. The weave of a few rugs,
  as some Anatolians, shows the weft crossing three times, that is,
  twice in one direction and once in the opposite direction. In the
  Genghas, Tcherkess, Bergamos, and in many rugs over one hundred
  and fifty years old, the threads of weft frequently cross many
  times; and it is not unusual for the number to vary in different
  parts of the same rug. In Plate <a href="#pb">B</a>, Figs. 15,
  16, and 17 (Page 49), is illustrated the appearance of the back
  of rugs in which a thread of weft crosses once, twice, and three
  times between two adjacent rows of knots. There are likewise rugs
  in which the number varies with methodical regularity; for
  instance, in Khorassans it is usual to find an extra thread of
  weft inserted at intervals of every few rows of knots; in many
  Herats the threads of weft cross twice between several successive
  rows of knots, then three times between the following several
  rows, and so continue to alternate; and in some of the Kulahs a
  thread of woollen weft that crosses twice alternates with a
  single coarser thread of jute.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id=
  "Page_55">55</a></span>As the shuttle passes back and forth, the
  thread of weft may be allowed considerable slack, so that when it
  is pressed down by the comb it will fit about the sides of the
  warp; or it may be drawn tightly across, so that it has a
  tendency to displace the threads of warp. If, for instance, a
  Hamadan and one of the Feraghans which, unlike the majority of
  them, has only one thread of weft crossing between the rows of
  knots, be examined, it will be seen that in the Hamadan the weft
  crosses with hardly any slack, so that the warp stands out
  clearly and well defined at the back; but that in the Feraghan
  the weft crosses with much slack, so that it folds about the
  warp, which accordingly seems slightly imbedded in it at the
  back. In some rugs the weft is passed across once with very
  slight slack, and as it recrosses it is allowed much slack. These
  features of the weave, which are followed with remarkable
  constancy in the same class, can be observed to advantage in a
  fragment of a rug cut transversely to the direction of the warp.
  If, for instance, the weft which crosses and recrosses between
  the rows of knots be carefully removed so as not to disturb its
  mould, it will be noticed in the case of many rugs that each
  thread of yarn has a similar shape of moderately deep
  undulations, which show how it conformed to the warp and indicate
  how slack it was when inserted. In the case of a few rugs, as the
  Luristans, each thread will likewise have similar undulations,
  but they will be very prominent. If, on the other hand, the weft
  be removed from some classes, as the Tabriz, Sarouk, and Kashan,
  one of the two threads will be almost straight or have slight
  undulations, while the other thread will have deep undulations.
  The weft of the Herez, Herats, old Khorassans, and Koniehs have
  the same peculiarities, excepting that the thread with very
  slight undulations is of three or four ply, while the other is of
  a single ply.</p>

  <p>The only instruments employed in weaving are the knife, comb,
  and scissors. The first is used, after each row of knots has been
  tied, to cut the ends of yarn to nearly the proper length; the
  second, to press firmly each row of knots; and the last, to trim
  the nap with care, so that the finished product may present an
  even and compact appearance.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Finish of Sides.</span>&mdash;As the sides
  are constantly exposed to wear weavers of different districts
  strengthen them in different ways, which may be designated as
  Weft Overcasting, Double Overcasting, Weft Selvage, Double
  Selvage, and Added Selvage. Each of these terms, though not
  euphonious, suggests the method employed. <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span> In Weft
  Overcasting (Plate <a href="#pb">B</a>, Fig. 11, Page 49) the
  thread of weft, after encircling the threads of warp to which the
  knots are tied, is wound about a much heavier cord that is strung
  at the side of the rug for a space equal to the thickness of the
  knots. It then partly encircles the threads of warp between the
  next two rows of knots as it passes to the other side, when it is
  wound about the heavy cord there. As this process continues, the
  cords at the sides are completely overcast with the thread of
  weft. When the sides have a Double Overcasting (Plate <a href=
  "#pb">B</a>, Fig. 12), heavy yarn is wound about the cord that
  has previously been encircled by the weft. Frequently several
  threads of yarn take the place of a single heavy cord. Weft
  Selvage (Plate <a href="#pb">B</a>, Fig. 13) is made by placing
  two or more heavy cords instead of a single one at the side of
  the warp, and encircling them by the weft in figure-eight
  fashion. As they extend beyond the rows of knots they form a
  plain flat selvage. The Double Selvage (Plate <a href=
  "#pb">B</a>, Fig. 14) is used among nomadic tribes such as the
  Beluches and Afghans, whose rugs receive an unusual amount of
  hard wear, so that an extra selvage is necessary. In adding this
  extra selvage the threads of weft are carried about the heavy
  cords, as in weft selvage, and then the extra yarn is wound over
  it in figure-eight fashion so as again to encircle the heavy
  cords. In Added Selvage the heavy cords are not encircled by the
  weft, but are attached to the side of the rug by the extra yarn
  that winds about them figure-eight fashion, and also encircles
  two or more adjoining threads of warp. Sometimes also the selvage
  is &ldquo;Mixed,&rdquo; or made by the weft encircling only one
  or two of the heavy cords, and then an extra yarn is wound about
  these and the remaining cord or cords. Moreover, the Double
  Overcasting and Double Selvage may be &ldquo;attached&rdquo; more
  firmly to the sides of the rug by the yarn passing in
  figure-eight fashion about the adjacent thread or threads of warp
  between the two rows of knots. When a Double Overcasting is thus
  &ldquo;attached,&rdquo; it is somewhat similar to a two-cord
  Double Selvage.</p>

  <p>These are the principal methods of finishing the sides, though
  they are sometimes modified by tribal customs. Simple as they
  seem, skill is required in both overcasting and making the
  selvage; for if carelessly done the sides are frequently made to
  curl. This is occasionally found to be the defect of old rugs,
  the worn sides of which have been recently overcast by
  inexperienced weavers. When such is the case, removing the
  stitches and overcasting with more care will remove the
  defect.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id=
  "Page_57">57</a></span><span class="smcap">Finish of
  Ends.</span>&mdash;The ends, which receive more attention than
  the sides, are treated in several different ways; and in many
  rugs a distinction exists between the treatment of each end. The
  simplest finish is where the warp and weft are woven like the
  threads of a kilim, and extend beyond the pile as a web, which
  may be exceedingly short, or, as in Beluches and Afghans, several
  inches long. Frequently the ends are finished by a selvage formed
  by cords heavier than the weft braided into the warp; or the
  upper end may be doubled back and hemmed. It is not unusual to
  find both web and selvage; but though the finish be web, selvage,
  or web and selvage, the warp of the end finished last generally
  forms a fringe, and often each end will have a fringe. Sometimes
  each separate thread of warp hangs loose; sometimes a number a
  foot or more in length are twisted together in cords; and again
  they are knotted or are tied to one another diagonally so as to
  form a network from which hang the loose ends. Very frequently
  the loops formed by the warp that encircled the rod extend beyond
  the web at the lower end of the rug, or else are braided about
  the ultimate thread of weft in the web. Though the warp and weft
  are generally undyed in the body of the rug, the web of the ends
  is very frequently coloured. Some of the webs, particularly those
  of the Beluches, are embroidered; and through others, as the
  Kurdistans, a parti-coloured cord runs transversely; still
  others, as Bergamos, are adorned with shells, beads, or other
  articles to avert the evil eye.</p>

  <p>In the study of rugs it should be remembered that the effect
  of rough usage is so considerable that in old pieces the webs of
  the ends have frequently disappeared, leaving short fringes
  composed of the ends of warp from which some rows of knots have
  been removed, and that recent overcasting of the sides may take
  the place of former selvage.</p>

  <p>The many characteristics of knot, warp, weft, sides, and ends,
  with all the variations made by innumerable tribes, remarkably
  constant in their methods, are technical peculiarities that are
  uninteresting to those who feel only an aesthetic interest in
  rugs, yet they demand the most careful consideration of whoever
  would learn to differentiate accurately between the many classes.
  Though admitting of exceptions, these peculiarities are real and
  definite, yet their analyses often require the subtlest
  perception of small though exact distinctions, without which
  expert understanding would be impossible.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

  <h4>DESIGNS AND SYMBOLS</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/h.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="H"
  title="H" /></span>OWEVER well woven, however resplendent in rich
  modulations of colour, Oriental rugs would quickly lose their
  fascination if in patterns and designs there were not at least
  some partial expression of the simple lives of the people, of
  their religious feelings, and of that veiled mysticism which
  pervades the thought of every Eastern race.</p>

  <p>In all nomadic rugs as well as in many others are innumerable
  reminders of common life. It may be only crude outlines of the
  goat or camel, or realistically drawn rose and lily; but even
  these are suggestive of associations.</p>

  <p>Religion, too, exercised on the character of rugs an important
  influence, which is expressed in the symbolism of both designs
  and colour. Without a doubt, some of these well-known designs
  have been transmitted from the earliest times, and were once
  associated with different forms of idolatry. Thus, among the old
  Babylonians the sun and moon, which are sometimes seen in the old
  pieces, represented particular deities; and very many of the
  oldest Chinese rugs that remain also contain symbols of their
  deities. In the early religion of Iran, which over 1000 years
  <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> was reduced to a system by
  Zoroaster, the elements were worshipped, so that designs
  representing these elements would likewise represent the divine
  forces they personified. This ancient fire worship of the
  Parsees, which even to-day has a few devotees in parts of Persia,
  and the kindred sun worship have added much to the symbolism of
  Oriental rugs. Buddhism also has contributed its share; and with
  the spread of Mohammedanism appeared a Saracenic influence that
  is frequently recognised. Even the two great sects of Mohammedan
  followers, the Shiites and Sunnites, have had distinct effects in
  the use of designs, as the former employed animal figures and the
  latter prohibited them.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id=
  "Page_59">59</a></span>There was, moreover, a symbolism that in a
  manner expressed the vague philosophic teachings of the ancient
  races. It was but natural that the early weaver engaged in
  tedious sedentary work, often requiring many months of constant
  application to complete, should endeavour to express therein not
  only artistic taste, but also the spirit of his innermost
  thoughts. So as he wove he sometimes left the result, though
  poorly defined and little understood to-day, of that struggle to
  interpret the great mysteries of the visible and unseen universe,
  from which arose the crude beginnings of philosophy.<a name=
  "FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class=
  "fnanchor">10</a></p>

  <p>The patterns, however, of many Oriental rugs are chiefly
  decorative. Even a casual examination shows that in all of them
  the coloured knots of the surface represent a border surrounding
  a central field. The former serves much the same function to the
  latter as a frame to a picture; yet its office is in no wise
  subordinate. Nor is there any part of the pattern more useful in
  determining the place of its origin. For this reason it is well
  to clearly define the special names which in this work are
  applied to its different parts. The lineal divisions are
  designated &ldquo;Stripes,&rdquo; though they are frequently
  spoken of as separate borders. At or near the centre of the
  border is the main stripe, which is generally accompanied by a
  much narrower pair, one on each side, known as &ldquo;Guard
  stripes.&rdquo; Very narrow stripes are sometimes called
  &ldquo;Ribbon stripes,&rdquo; and those of only one or two knots
  in width are called &ldquo;Lines.&rdquo; The latter are of solid
  colour or have the simplest geometric device. The decoration of
  the ribbon stripes is also necessarily simple; but in the main
  stripe of artistic rugs the patterns are often exceedingly
  elaborate, of exquisite colours, and co-ordinate in character
  with those of the field.</p>

  <p>The fields display even greater diversity of pattern than the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id=
  "Page_60">60</a></span>borders. Frequently they are covered with
  a heterogeneous mass of detached and unrelated figures, as in
  many of the nomadic rugs; or, on the other hand, are entirely
  covered with repetitive patterns, as in the Turkomans; or with
  intricate and correlated designs, as in the diaper and floral
  patterns of so many of the Persian and Indian rugs. Others
  consist of a background of solid colour on which appear isolated
  formal designs, as in some of the Khorassans, or medallions on
  which are represented smaller figures, as in some of the old
  Sehnas and Feraghans. Occasionally the medallions are so large as
  to extend to the sides and ends of the fields, and thus separate
  the corners into nearly triangular shaped sections, such as are
  characteristic of a number of Persian and one or two Caucasian
  rugs. In a few of the latter, also, the fields are covered with
  large geometric figures suggesting the medallions. It is only
  within comparatively modern times that weavers have used solid
  colours for large portions of the fields. The intent no doubt was
  a saving in labour and pains, but the effect is frequently most
  gratifying; as when, for instance, the space beneath the arch of
  Asia Minor prayer rugs is of a uniform red, blue, or cream,
  relieved only by a gracefully suspended lamp, the tree of life,
  or some other emblem of immortality.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The patterns of prayer rugs are not only pleasing, but have a
  peculiar importance, as weavers of certain sections of the
  country adhere so strictly to time-honoured traditions that the
  shape of the arch, or mihrab, which is the principal feature,
  often denotes the class, as well as the group, to which they
  belong. Some of these arches are illustrated in Plates <a href=
  "#pc">C</a> and <a href="#pd">D</a> (Pages 61 and 63), from which
  it will be seen that in Persian rugs they are formed by
  gracefully curving lines, but that in rugs of other groups, with
  the exception of a very few old Ghiordes pieces, they are
  geometric. The peculiarities of the arches of the several
  classes, also, are observable; as those of the Beluchistans,
  which are rectilinear and relatively high, and those of the
  Bokharas, which are tent-shaped, flat, and small. In the
  Caucasian group they have a marked resemblance to one another and
  also to those of the Turkoman rugs, but are larger than the
  latter. Again, the arch of almost all Asia Minor rugs rises
  higher than those of any others, excepting the Persian, and
  extends from one side of the field to the other. In many of them
  a panel is placed above the spandrel, and occasionally a second
  panel is placed beneath the field. Above the niche of some Asia
  Minor and Caucasian prayer rugs <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>is woven a small rhomboidal
  figure, where the suppliant plants the pebble or bit of earth
  that he has brought from Mecca; and at the sides of a few arches
  are crude figures, where are placed the hands during the act of
  worship. More than one arch is the exception; but now and then
  are seen two and even four, one above the other, or several
  parallel to one another. These and other special features
  associated with prayer rugs will be considered more fully in
  subsequent chapters.</p>

  <p>The smaller designs that appear in rugs and compose the
  general pattern are distinguished as geometric and floral
  ornamentation. The former is adopted in those countries where the
  population is principally nomadic; and the latter is the accepted
  style in countries where exist numerous towns and cities in which
  the arts have been cultivated and where a large percentage of the
  population have enjoyed an advanced state of society. Thus in
  Caucasia, Turkestan, Afghanistan, and Beluchistan geometric
  designs are characteristic of the rugs; but in China, India,
  Persia, and part of Asia Minor floral designs prevail. Sir George
  Birdwood, an eminent authority on Oriental rugs, has made the
  statement that the geometric designs are found among the lower
  Turanian and the floral among the higher Aryan. But it seems most
  probable that the adoption of the geometric or floral style of
  ornamentation is due not so much to racial distinctions as to the
  state to which the textile art had advanced among the different
  peoples and to the waves of influence that at times spread over
  the countries. Thus the early rugs of Asia Minor had patterns
  that were more geometric than those of later times, and during
  the period when the Mongols ruled in Persia geometric patterns
  were more frequently employed in the rugs of that country than
  subsequently.</p>

  <p>In all rugs, however, some trace of the floral design appears.
  Even in the Turkoman weavings, the pattern of which is strictly
  geometric, some vestige of the tree of life is manifest. In the
  fields of Caucasian rugs, in which are represented squares,
  octagons, triangles, diagonals, lozenges, stars, etc., the
  weavers have depicted designs that are almost as geometric as
  those of the Turkoman rugs by which they have been influenced;
  but, on the other hand, large numbers of the border designs are
  distinctly floral. In the rugs of China and Asia Minor are found
  both geometric and floral ornamentation, the latter predominating
  in pieces woven during the last two centuries, and the former in
  those of earlier date. Among &gt;<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span> the woven fabrics of India
  and Persia, however, few traces of the geometric pattern remain;
  but vines, leaves, and flowers form the favourite theme for
  decoration.</p>

  <p>The floral patterns are the result of many centuries of
  growth, that reached its highest development in the Persian
  carpets of the XVI and XVII Centuries; and since then till the
  present time they have continued as the most characteristic
  features of the rugs of that country and India. They represent
  the highest technique of the weaver. In the borders are generally
  represented vines from which are pendant rosettes, palmettes, or
  flowers; and in the fields, particularly those of the fine
  antique rugs, are a profusion of floral forms realistically
  portrayed. On long, gracefully twining and intertwining stems is
  often the rose, pink, violet, lotus, crocus, narcissus, or daisy.
  But if the rug is more modern, in its field of uniform colour may
  be represented a central medallion covered with delicate tracings
  enriched by bright-coloured conventionalised flowers.</p>

  <p>In the general pattern of all rugs are interwoven particular
  designs or motives that give them a distinctive character and
  render the greatest assistance in distinguishing the groups and
  classes. Thus the serrated leaf and wine cup (Plate <a href=
  "#pi">I</a>, Fig. 1, opp. Page 226) is found only in Caucasian
  and old Armenian rugs; and the design represented in Plate
  <a href="#ph">H</a>, Fig. 10 (opp. Page 194), suggestive of some
  Chinese character, is found almost exclusively in Kulahs. Not
  only are all designs important as aids in classification, but
  they have a special interest, as it is maintained by writers of
  the highest authority that when employed by the earliest weavers
  each had a symbolic meaning. To be sure, the origin of many has
  been lost in the remote past and is unknown even to those who now
  employ them; but others still represent definite ideas, as they
  did centuries ago, and portray to some extent the thought of the
  weaver. They therefore deserve the most careful study.</p>

    <p class="center">Loaned by C. F. Williams, Esq., to the

  </div>

  <p>Few of these designs have been transmitted from a more remote
  past or have been more universally employed than has been the
  figure <img class="floatInsert" src="images/ssign.jpg" width="22" height="27" alt=
  "Symbol: S" /> or <img class="floatInsert" src=
  "images/hssign.jpg" width="22" height="28" alt="Symbol: horizontal S" />. It appears in
  each of the groups of Oriental rugs excepting the Chinese; and
  two of the forms it assumes are exceedingly like the arms of the
  swastika and parts of the fret as occasionally seen in Chinese
  designs. In Indian rugs it is rarely found except in the borders,
  which may have been copied from those of other countries. It is
  very commonly seen in the Beluchistans, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>Tekkes, and
  Beshires, of the Central Asiatic group; and in the rugs of the
  Persian group that show nomadic influences. There is probably not
  a single class of the Caucasian group, nor any of the Asia Minor
  group, with the exception of the old Ghiordes, in which it is not
  sometimes represented. It may be seen near the corner of the Asia
  Minor &ldquo;Dragon and Ph&oelig;nix&rdquo; carpet of the XIV
  Century, illustrated in Plate <a href="#p20">20</a> (opp. Page
  88); and appears in some of the old Armenian carpets, which are
  believed to be even older. That it was associated with sun
  worship and regarded as an emblem of light and the deity is the
  accepted belief. It is possible, however, that it was intended by
  some weavers to represent the serpent, which among many different
  races is emblematic of superhuman knowledge.</p>

  <p>Probably no other design has been more universally employed
  than the swastika, which appears in the textile fabrics of North
  American Indians, on the Maya ruins of Yucatan, among the
  monuments of the Nile, and on the temples of India. Widely as is
  its distribution, its most usual form of intersecting right
  angles is found in each of these countries. It is not improbable
  that it originated in China, where it is a most common decorative
  motive, and was almost invariably represented in the borders and
  in many of the medallions of rugs woven before the beginning of
  the XVIII Century. It is also very frequently seen in the rugs of
  Samarkand, and occasionally in those of Caucasia. It seldom
  appears in the rugs of Persia, Asia Minor, or Turkestan. The
  universality of the design indicates its great antiquity, yet its
  primitive symbolic meaning of abundance, fertility, and
  prosperity has never been lost. Some of its different forms are
  shown in Plate <a href="#po">O</a>, Figs. 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, and
  5f (Page 291).</p>

  <p>The reciprocal trefoil (Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 17,
  opp. Page 158) is a very usual design in Caucasian and Persian
  rugs; it is often found in some of the rugs of India and in
  Beluchistans, but is very rarely seen in other classes of the
  Central Asiatic or in the Chinese and Asia Minor groups. Its
  origin is uncertain, but since it appears in the &ldquo;Polish
  Carpets&rdquo; and other antique Persian carpets of strictly
  floral pattern, where its drawing is more elaborate than in
  modern rugs, it is not improbable that it is the conventionalised
  form of the lily or a spray bearing three leaves, and that it has
  the emblematic significance of the tree form.</p>

  <p>Among all primitive races the sun, moon, and stars have been
  associated with their religion, so that it is surprising that so
  few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id=
  "Page_66">66</a></span> emblems of them are recognised in rugs.
  In the theology of the Chaldees, from which the earliest weavers
  must have received inspiration, the sun was regarded as one of
  their principal deities and the moon as another. The sun is
  generally represented by a plain circle, a circle with diameters
  intersecting at right angles, or a circle with small ovals
  intersecting at right angles; the moon is represented by the
  crescent. Of much more frequent occurrence is the eight-pointed
  star, another inheritance of those ancient times when all
  primitive races worshipped the heavenly bodies. It represented
  the female principle of the Chaldean sun god; and it is believed,
  too, that it represented the deity to the Medes, ancestors of
  many of the present Persians. There is a tradition among some
  Eastern races that King Solomon wore a ring of diamonds arranged
  in the form of an eight-pointed star, and also a crown containing
  a large star of which the eight points and centre were composed
  of precious stones of different colour. A star now and then seen
  in rugs with colours so arranged is known as
  &ldquo;Mohammedan&rsquo;s jewel design.&rdquo; The six-pointed
  star, a Jewish symbol for the &ldquo;shield of David,&rdquo; was
  adopted as a talisman by some of the Moslems. All of these stars
  are chiefly nomadic symbols, they rarely if ever are seen in the
  rugs of China or India, they are only occasionally found in those
  of Persia, and are of most frequent occurrence in the Caucasian
  pieces.</p>

  <p>Another design is an octagonal-shaped disc (Plate <a href=
  "#po">O</a>, Fig. 10, Page 291), usually about two and a half
  inches in diameter, on the face of which and extending the full
  width are figures somewhat like hour-glasses placed at right
  angles to one another. It seems not improbable that it is of the
  same origin as the large designs that appear in the field of the
  Holbein rug of the XV Century, illustrated in Plate <a href=
  "#p21">21</a> (opp. Page 92). It is a very old motive, and is
  sometimes regarded as a dial symbolising the diurnal motion of
  the earth. It is of very frequent occurrence in nomadic rugs; and
  is found in Beluchistans, in nearly all Caucasians, in some rugs
  from Asia Minor, and in only a very few from Persia.</p>

  <p>The zigzag line, known as the water motive, is found in many
  of the rugs of China, India, Persia, Caucasia, and Asia Minor, as
  well as in the Beluchistans and Beshires of the Central Asiatic
  group, though in some instances it appears as little more than a
  serrated line. It is represented in the narrow guard-stripes of
  some of the Western Asia Minor carpets of the XV Century.
  According to Mr. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id=
  "Page_67">67</a></span> John Mumford, &ldquo;even in the oldest
  Egyptian symbolism a zigzag line stood for water and by
  implication for eternity; and a succession of these arranged to
  represent the sea has long been a recognised carpet design in
  India, China, and Persia.&rdquo;</p>

  <h4><i>COLOUR PLATE III&mdash;MOSUL RUG</i></h4>

  <p><i>Long before the commercial instinct had been felt among the
  weavers of the Orient, one or more of them dwelling in the
  Mesopotamian valley tied the knots of this old Mosul. The central
  field is of camel&rsquo;s hair that shades from a rich dark
  chestnut at one end to lighter tones at the other, and is
  enlivened by bright flowers representing those found on the
  river&rsquo;s banks. This variation of ground colour, the small
  geometric designs at the extreme ends of the fields, the
  eight-pointed stars of the main stripe of the border, and some of
  the drawing are nomadic characteristics. The dainty vine and
  flower of the narrow guard stripes, on the other hand, show
  Persian influence. This piece represents a type of which few now
  remain.</i></p>

  <p>One of the most common designs is what has been called the
  &ldquo;latch-hook.&rdquo; When there is a long succession of
  latch-hooks with the straight ends resting on a line and the
  hooked ends inclined in the same direction, as in Plate <a href=
  "#pk">K</a>, Fig. 20 (opp. Page 230), they are called
  &ldquo;running latch-hooks.&rdquo; Since they appear in the
  Dragon and Ph&oelig;nix rug (opp. Page 88), that was probably
  woven about the end of the XIV Century, they are evidently a very
  old design, which not improbably was derived from the Chinese
  fret. The hook is of different shapes, and is sometimes
  perpendicular, sometimes inclined. Its particular function is to
  shade or subdue the harsh effect of a sudden transition from one
  colour to another that is entirely different. As such a device is
  unnecessary in artistic rugs of intricate designs, it is rarely
  seen in any Indian or Persian piece, excepting the modern Shiraz
  that frequently adopts geometric patterns; but it is found in all
  the rugs of Caucasia, Central Asia, and in most of those of Asia
  Minor. It is in fact as universal as the reciprocal trefoil.</p>

  <p>In rugs of geometric patterns are occasionally found both
  Greek and Roman crosses. The latter are represented in most of
  the Soumak rugs, and appear profusely in old Asia Minor or
  Armenian rugs, in which they were probably woven with the intent
  to convey a religious significance; but in many instances crosses
  are not used symbolically.</p>

  <p>The design of a comb (Plate <a href="#po">O</a>, Fig. 11, Page
  291) is a Mohammedan emblem suggestive of cleanliness, yet it is
  not improbable that it is sometimes intended to represent the
  instrument employed in pressing the threads of weft closely
  against the knots. It is found mostly in Caucasian rugs, and
  rarely in those of other groups.</p>

  <p>In a large number of the finest carpets woven in Persia three
  or four centuries ago was represented what is known as the
  Chinese cloud-band (Plate <a href="#po">O</a>, Fig. 7). It
  appeared in Persia about the middle of the XV Century, and was
  conspicuous in the carpets of Herat, Tabriz, and Gilan, as well
  as in many of the &ldquo;Polish Carpets.&rdquo; Later it was
  introduced into Asia Minor, but was never represented in any of
  the strictly nomadic weavings. It appears in only a very few of
  the modern rugs, and these are mostly Persian. Nor is
  it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id=
  "Page_68">68</a></span> recognised in its usual form in any of
  the Chinese rugs that now exist; though without a doubt it
  originated with the Chinese, since their early mythology placed
  the abode of the Supreme Ruler in the Constellation of Ursa
  Major, of which the stars of the Big Dipper were represented in
  early art as enveloped in a band of clouds; but in more
  conventionalised ornamentation the stars are omitted and the band
  remains. As a motive, then, it is symbolic of heaven and the
  deity.</p>

  <p>In almost all rugs are found expressions of vegetable life, as
  a twig, vine, flower, or tree. Sometimes they are most
  naturalistic, again they are partly conventionalised, or so
  disguised, as in nomadic rugs of geometric designs, that only by
  study and comparison of many forms in a series can their origin
  be established. This universal adoption of floral form was due to
  something more than an aesthetic love for the beautiful, since in
  every country of the East some part of the tree or plant was
  emblematic. Moreover, a tree form known as the Tree of Life had a
  religious significance among many races. The Jews were told that
  in the Garden of Eden grew the &ldquo;Tree of Knowledge of Good
  and Evil;&rdquo; and in the Book of Revelation the Apostle John
  speaks of &ldquo;The Tree of Life which bore twelve manner of
  fruits and yielded her fruit every month, and the leaves of the
  tree were for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; From this
  passage may have been borrowed the belief of the Mohammedans in
  the Tree of Life which grew in Paradise, and spread its branches
  that true believers might rest beneath them and enjoy its fruits
  and the companionship of beautiful houri. In the ancient lore of
  China is the Taoist tradition of the Tree of Life, growing by the
  Sea of Jade, that confers immortality on the fortunate who may
  gather and eat its fruits; also the tradition of the mountain top
  where grows the sacred tree on which the elect may climb and
  mount to heaven. Even among the ancient Chaldees was a story of a
  tree that grew to heaven and sheltered the earth. In different
  countries the Tree of Life is represented by different kinds; in
  Yarkand of Eastern Turkestan it takes the form of a cedar; in
  Persia it is generally the cypress. Wherever employed it is
  symbolic of knowledge, resurrection, immortality.</p>

  <p>No other form of vegetable life was so universally employed in
  Oriental symbolism as the lotus flower (Plate <a href=
  "#po">O</a>, Figs. 16a, b, and c), since the Egyptian, Assyrian,
  Indian, Chinese, and Persian alike did it reverence. It was,
  perhaps, first employed emblematically<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span> in the
  valley of the Nile, but later it was held in high esteem by the
  inhabitants of India where the floating blossom is regarded as an
  emblem of the world. It was inseparately associated with Buddha,
  and its religious significance must have extended with the spread
  of Buddhism. Professor Goodyear regards a large number of designs
  that apparently are not related in form as derived from it
  through a long series of evolutions. During the highest
  development of the textile art in Persia it appears most
  realistically drawn in a large number of the carpets, especially
  the so-called Ispahans, or Herats, and the so-called Polish. It
  is also most artistically represented in the fabrics of India,
  and is a favourite design for Chinese weavers. But in other
  modern rugs it is seldom used as a motive, and is so
  conventionalised as often to escape notice.</p>

  <p>If the lotus was the first flower to be represented in early
  woven fabrics, as seems not improbable, several others have met
  with greater favour among modern weavers. Of these the rose,
  which is cultivated extensively in the gardens of the East,
  appears in a large number of the rugs of Persia and Asia Minor.
  Moreover, a pattern frequently seen in many old Persian rugs is
  an all-over pattern of small bushes with flowering roses. Almost
  equally popular is the lily, which is characteristic of many of
  the rugs of India and of a few of Western Asia Minor. The
  &ldquo;Euphrates flower,&rdquo; which grows by the river banks of
  the Mesopotamian valley, is also occasionally found as an
  all-over pattern in some of the rugs of Western Iran and Southern
  Caucasia. Less frequently seen and still less frequently
  recognised, as they are generally woven in small figures, are the
  daisy, anemone, crocus, narcissus, pink, and violet. All are
  depicted chiefly on account of their associations and beauty, and
  whatever emblematic meaning they are intended to convey is
  generally no more than that of their colours. There are, however,
  in a few old Persian carpets designs of sunflowers, which were
  accepted by the Zoroastrians and the earlier sun and fire
  worshippers as symbols of the sun and emblems of light.</p>

  <p>Of the fruits of the earth none is more highly esteemed than
  the pomegranate, which was sculptured in temples of Mesopotamia
  and embroidered on the robes of Assyrian and Jewish priests. In
  the days of King Solomon it was cultivated in Palestine, where
  the Israelites, like modern Persians, made a sherbet by mixing
  its juice with sugar and spices. At the time of Homer it was
  cultivated in Phrygia. Now it grows wild over vast tracts of
  Syria, Persia, and Asia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70"
  id="Page_70">70</a></span> Minor. Yet it rarely appears
  conspicuously in any woven fabrics excepting the Ladik prayer
  rugs, in which it is invariably seen. Since the weavers of these,
  whether Christian or Moslem, would probably be familiar with many
  of the old Jewish and Assyrian rites, it is not unlikely that it
  refers emblematically to its religious associations rather than
  symbolises, as has been suggested, the idea of fruitfulness as
  expressed in the Turkish wedding custom where the bride throws a
  pomegranate at her feet that the scattered seed may fore-tell the
  number of her children.</p>

  <p>In almost every rug of Persia, India, and Asia Minor there is
  in some part of the border a vine with pendant leaves, flowers,
  rosettes, or palmettes; and even in many Caucasian rugs of
  geometric pattern the vine with its appendages is seen in
  conventionalised form. In a few of the more sumptuous carpets,
  where the drawing is elaborate, delicate tendrils bearing flowers
  or the more formal designs of the Herati border take the place of
  the vine, from which they were evolved. In such borders the
  designs generally convey no symbolic meaning, but the simpler
  vine encircling the field without beginning or end represents
  symbolically the continuity of purpose and permanency.</p>

  <p>One of the most interesting designs (Plate <a href=
  "#po">O</a>, Fig. 6, Page 291) is known as the Cone, Palm, Mango,
  Almond, River Loop, and Pear. By some it is believed to represent
  no more than the closed palm of the hand, since there is an old
  tradition in Persia that a weaver once asked his little son to
  devise for him a new design, whereupon the boy thrust his hand
  into a pot of dye, then placed it sidewise upon a piece of white
  linen, on which became impressed the &ldquo;palm&rdquo; design
  formed by the hand and incurving small finger. By some it is
  regarded as a cluster of old Iranian crown jewels. To others, who
  point to the well-known pattern of the Kashmir weaving, it
  denotes the bend of the river Jhelum above Srinagar in the valley
  of Kashmir; and to Sir George Birdwood it symbolises the flame
  sacred to ancient fire worshippers. In this work it will be
  called the Pear, the name now generally applied to it. In the
  course of the many centuries that have elapsed since its origin,
  and in its migration through India, Persia, Turkestan, Caucasia,
  and Asia Minor, it has adopted more strange shapes than any other
  device. In the rugs of Sarabend it is represented in its
  best-known form of simple curving lines, in the Bakus its
  identity is almost lost on account of its geometric appearance,
  and in the fabrics of India it is often very <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>ornate.
  Though its origin is hidden in the mists of the past, when its
  antiquity is considered, and also the devotion of the early races
  to the glowing orb of the sun and to terrestrial fires, it is not
  surprising that it has been regarded as a relic of the
  Zoroastrian faith of old Iran, symbolising the eternal flames
  before which the Parsees worshipped.</p>

  <p>If the floral designs are more beautiful, others are more
  truly symbolic, and when appearing in rugs of barbaric patterns
  they are more interesting. Of these the creeping things are
  represented by the serpent, scorpion, turtle, crab, and
  tarantula. Among a few races of Asia the serpent, which is found
  in a few old Persian carpets, has been regarded as emblematic of
  immortality, but has been more frequently considered as the
  symbol of knowledge. The scorpion, also, was supposed to
  represent the idea of knowledge. It does not often appear in
  woven design, but is sometimes drawn with careful precision in
  Caucasian fabrics. The turtle or tortoise stands for constancy.
  What is called the &ldquo;turtle border&rdquo; (Plate <a href=
  "#pe">E</a>, Fig. 3, opp. Page 156), which was probably derived
  from interlacing arabesques, occurs most frequently in Feraghans
  and also in some other Persian rugs, as Muskabads, Sarabends,
  Serapis, and even the Sehnas. The tarantula and crab designs are
  found exclusively in borders of Caucasian rugs. As their
  resemblance to the animals they are supposed to represent is
  remote, it is most probable that they are simply the
  conventionalised forms of the star and palmette.</p>

  <p>Among the designs seen in Chinese rugs are several not found
  in any others. Of these the dragon, originally intended as a
  symbol of the infinite, denotes imperial power; the stork, long
  life; the duck, conjugal felicity; the bat, happiness; and the
  butterfly, a spirit. These designs will be noticed in the chapter
  on Chinese rugs.</p>

  <p>With few exceptions the only modern rugs in which birds are
  represented are the Persian. The drawing as a rule is far from
  natural; but in the fine old carpets it is often so accurate as
  to show unmistakably the order to which they belong. Several of
  them were used symbolically, as the bird of paradise, suggestive
  of felicity; the peacock, symbol of fire; the eagle, emblem of
  power. The attitude, to be sure, in which they appear, affects in
  a measure their symbolic meaning; as an eagle in flight denotes
  good fortune, but one in the act of descending denotes ill
  luck.</p>

  <p>As the Mohammedan religion interdicts portraying birds and
  beasts as well as human forms, they are rarely seen in any rug
  of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id=
  "Page_72">72</a></span> Western Asia Minor, which is inhabited by
  the Sunnites, the strict conformists to the law of the Koran; but
  in Mohammedan countries lying farther to the east, where the
  Shiites or nonconformists live, animal designs are very common.
  In modern rugs of Persia and Caucasia, dogs, goats, and camels
  are the most popular animal subjects, but the drawing is often so
  poor that the identity is in doubt. In the old carpets, on the
  other hand, animals and human beings were most realistically
  drawn, and were intended to represent symbolically the
  weaver&rsquo;s thought. In fact, those masterpieces of Persian
  art known as the &ldquo;Hunting Carpets&rdquo; would lose much of
  their interest if their many forms of animal life were without
  symbolic meaning. In them the lion is a symbol of victory, power,
  the sun, and the day; the antelope and unicorn are symbols of
  restfulness and the moon. The lion destroying an antelope would
  mean, then, the victory of day over night, or of a powerful over
  a weak foe. Leopards and hounds likewise symbolise success and
  fame. There are also mythological creatures, as the ph&oelig;nix,
  emblematic of life and resurrection, and the winged <i>djinni</i>
  or Persian spirits, that often adorn the fields and borders of
  some of the elaborate antique carpets of Iran.</p>

  <p>Not only the forms of vegetable and animal life and their
  relative attitudes to one another were intended to convey a
  symbolic meaning, but among almost all ancient races colours had
  a special significance. To the Moslems no colour was more sacred
  than the green, which, though difficult to produce in beautiful
  tones, they have placed in the fields of many of their prayer
  rugs. To them, also, blue was the emblem of eternity, and in the
  spandrels above the arches it was the symbol of the sky. Though
  to the Hindoo it denotes ill luck, it was the chosen colour of
  the Persians, as well as one of the imperial colours of the
  Chinese. Among all nations yellow, another imperial colour of
  China, and red are suggestive of joy and happiness. Such colours,
  when used in conjunction with other emblems, expressed not only
  beauty, but also different shades of thought.</p>

  <p>These are but a few of the many motives that are employed by
  the weaver. Some of them represent objects intimately associated
  with his daily life. Some of them reflect his thoughts and
  emotions. Others are the still unsolved hieroglyphics of his
  craft. When, then, we examine some old worn rug, we may see only
  an exquisite pattern resplendent in the deep rich colours of an
  art <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id=
  "Page_73">73</a></span>now lost; but if to an &aelig;sthetic
  taste be added an interest in a symbolism that expresses
  something of the thought and life of the weaver, we may find in
  the study of the various designs another charm that increases
  with the discovery of any previously hidden meaning.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

  <h4>RUG WEAVING BEFORE THE XVIII CENTURY</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/t.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="T"
  title="T" /></span>HERE are no records to definitely indicate in
  what land the art of rug weaving originated, or to disprove that
  it developed independently in different lands. It would be
  unreasonable, then, to assume that rugs were not woven in
  northern regions as early as in southern. In fact, during the
  Neolithic age the Lake-dwellers of Switzerland grew and spun
  flax, and it is believed that they had looms. Moreover, it is
  probable that the savages of cold climates soon learned to weave
  garments with the long wool of their sheep or goats; and the
  similar process of weaving mats for the floors of their huts
  would naturally follow. Nevertheless, such evidence as now
  remains points to the civilisations of the Euphrates or the Nile,
  as the birthplace of this art.</p>

  <p>Though we do not know when the first rugs were made, without a
  doubt they existed before the pyramids of Egypt or the palaces of
  Babylon had risen from the plains. Among the rock-cut tombs of
  Beni-Hassan in Egypt, that date from about 2500 B. C. are
  pictures of men with spindles, of looms and weavers. There is
  also unmistakable evidence of the antiquity of a high state of
  the textile art among the ruins in the valleys of the Tigris and
  the Euphrates. On carved walls of the palaces of Nineveh, where
  dwelt the rulers of Assyria over three thousand years ago, are
  elaborate drawings indicating that carpets of remarkable
  workmanship were then in use. In the borders of some of the robes
  worn by the rulers are designs of rosettes and latch-hooks, and
  on one is depicted the tree of life, similar to what may be seen
  in modern rugs. Nor are ancient writers silent. In the Old
  Testament are frequent references to woven fabrics. Homer, also,
  speaks of them in his Odyssey. Herodotus, Diodorus, Pliny,
  Strabo, in fact almost all classic writers have mentioned them.
  Moreover, designs on pot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75"
  id="Page_75">75</a></span>tery, bowls, tiles, and walls, similar
  in appearance to those found in the oldest existing carpets,
  carry contributory evidence to their antiquity and character.</p>

  <p>This art, that necessity created, comfort nourished, and
  luxury matured, has been a process of slow development. To the
  mind of some dark tribeswoman of the desert contemplating the
  rushes gathered from a sluggish stream and strewn upon the floor
  of her master&rsquo;s hut several thousand years ago, may have
  been suggested the first idea of a mat. Indeed, from earliest
  times mats of reeds, straw, bamboo, or other pliable material
  have been constantly made. At first they were doubtless without
  ornament; later they were coloured with dyes obtained from roots
  and herbs to increase their attractiveness; finally designs
  symbolic of nature or the deity were embroidered on them. As
  wealth and luxury increased the ornamentation became more
  elaborate, until during the rule of the Caliphs the mats rivalled
  in beauty the carpets for which, during the summer months, they
  were substituted. &ldquo;On these mats,&rdquo; wrote the eminent
  authority, Dr. F. R. Martin, &ldquo;the artist found free scope
  for displaying as much artistic skill as on the real carpets, and
  gold threads were intertwined to make them as precious as the
  most expensive silk and gold carpets.&rdquo; Long, however,
  before they had reached such a high state of perfection, they
  would have suggested the idea of making warmer and more durable
  floor coverings. The first of these was a simple web of warp and
  woof; later they assumed a character not dissimilar to the kilims
  now made in the lands of their origin. With further advance, more
  elaborate carpets and tapestries were made; but it was not until
  the art had been developing for a great many centuries, that
  there appeared those most perfect products of knotted pile that
  were similar in kind but superior in quality to the modern
  pieces.</p>

  <p>Slow as was this development, as early as the Christian era,
  the work of the most skilled weavers of the Orient deserved to be
  classed as a fine art. During the time of the Sassanian kingdom
  (extending from about 226 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> to 632
  <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>) carpets of elaborate design and
  finish were produced in Mesopotamia and Syria. Most of them were
  of the wool of sheep or goats; and in them were represented
  designs of trees, birds, animals, and other figures. Other pieces
  were made of silk richly embroidered with silver and gold.
  Moreover, authentic evidence from the VI Century <span class=
  "smcap">a. d.</span> not only gives us positive knowledge of the
  marvellous workmanship of that time,<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span> but
  enables us to conjecture through what a long period of
  progression the artisans had been labouring to arrive at such
  results. Dr. Karabacek, director of the Imperial Library of
  Vienna, in his monograph &ldquo;Die Persische Nadelmalerei
  Susandschird,&rdquo; gave the following description of the
  &ldquo;Spring of Chosroes&rdquo; carpet:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When Ctesiphon, the residence of the Sassanides, fell
  into the hands of the Arabs in the year 637 <span class=
  "smcap">a. d.</span>, they found in the royal palace, the ruins
  of which still remain, a colossal carpet of 1051 square
  metres,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> which was originally made
  for Chosroes I. His successor, Anoschar (531-579 <span class=
  "smcap">a. d.</span>), used it also, but only during the stormy
  weather, when remaining in the gardens was impracticable. The
  festivities were then transferred to the palace, where a garden
  with the beauty of springtime was represented by the pattern of
  the carpet. This was the Winter Carpet that was called in Persia
  the Spring of Chosroes. Its material, which was marvellous and
  costly, consisted of silk, gold, silver, and precious stones. On
  it was represented a beautiful pleasure ground with brooks and
  interlacing paths, with trees and flowers of springtime. On the
  wide borders surrounding it were represented flower-beds in which
  precious stones coloured blue, red, yellow, white, and green
  denoted the beauty of the flowers. Gold imitated the
  yellow-coloured soil and defined the borders of the brooks, where
  the water was represented by crystals. Gravel paths were
  indicated by stones of the size of pearls. The stalks of trees
  were of gold and silver, the leaves and flowers of silk, the
  fruits of many-coloured stones.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As the value of this carpet was estimated at about three
  quarters of a million dollars, it was regarded as too precious to
  fall to the lot of a single captor, and was accordingly divided
  into segments to be distributed as booty among the soldiers. Even
  if during this period there was no other fabric so valuable and
  elaborate, it represented the importance of the textile art
  during the dynasty of the Sassanides.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

    title="" />

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 15. Persian Animal
    Carpet in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>During the Caliphate (632 to 1258 <span class="smcap">a.
  d.</span>) the Moslem rulers, devoted to luxury, preserved the
  art treasures of their conquered subjects and encouraged them to
  renewed efforts. This is particularly true of the Caliphs and
  sultans of Syria and Egypt. A carpet that adorned the banquet
  hall of the Caliph Hisham of Egypt, who died 743 A. D., was of
  silk interwoven with strands of gold, and had a length of three
  hundred feet and a breadth of one hundred and <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>fifty feet.
  All of the rooms of the Egyptian palaces, occupied by the
  sultans, contained carpets of silk and satin; and the mosques of
  Syria were similarly furnished. In the year 1067 <span class=
  "smcap">a. d.</span> one of the Caliphs was forced to sell his
  accumulated treasures, which consisted, besides jewels and works
  of art, of about four thousand bales of carpets. Dr. Martin
  states that a single one of these bales contained several hundred
  perfect carpets, which were woven in silk and gold, and that some
  of them contained portraits of entire royal families. One of
  them, valued at about $300,000, was made for the Caliph el Mirz
  li alla in the year 964 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> It was
  of blue silk, on which were represented the heavens and the
  earth, seas and rivers, as well as the holy cities Mecca and
  Medina. Such was the character of some of the carpets woven
  during the days of the Caliphs.</p>

  <p>As the imperfect records which have been left us indicate that
  the finest carpet collections of this period were in the mosques
  and palaces of Syria and Egypt, it has been assumed that they
  were woven by the native artisans. To some extent this is
  doubtless true, as rug weaving was one of the oldest industries
  of these countries. But it is more probable that most of them
  were made elsewhere and were acquired as presents or by purchase.
  Some were made in Armenia, Assyria, and Turkestan; but the
  largest number, as well as the most costly and elaborate,
  doubtless came from the same hills and towns of Persia where many
  of the finest pieces are woven to-day. In several of these towns
  as many as three or four hundred looms were constantly at work;
  and since the carpets consisted of warp and weft only, it is
  probable that they were produced far more rapidly than modern
  rugs in which knots are tied to the warp. But if they lacked the
  richness of deep, heavy pile, they were elaborately woven with
  threads of gold and silver, and were often embellished with
  precious stones.</p>

  <h4>ANTIQUE PERSIAN CARPETS</h4>

  <p>To the tendency of overestimating the age of art objects to
  which antiquity adds value, there is no exception in the case of
  Oriental rugs, yet there is good reason to believe that a few
  pieces still exist that were woven in Persia as early as the XIII
  or XIV Century. Indeed, we cannot positively affirm that there
  may not be religiously preserved some relic of the Seljukian
  dynasty, which ruled in Persia till about 1150 <span class=
  "smcap">a. d.</span>, for we have little knowledge <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span> of what
  some of the old mosques which no Christian has ever entered may
  contain; but it is more probable that the oldest remaining pieces
  belong to the Mongolian period, which began with the invasion of
  the armies of Genghis Khan in the first half of the XIII Century.
  This conclusion is based partly on the facts that their archaic
  patterns indicate a very remote period, and that they suggest
  early Mongolian influences. Moreover, as the age of rugs of a
  somewhat later period can be determined by the evidence of
  similarity of their designs with those of early tiles, metal
  work, pottery, and miniatures, of established age, it is possible
  to infer the relative age of these older pieces by comparison of
  patterns showing a progressive development.</p>

  <p>One of the oldest Persian pieces now existing, the property of
  C. F. Williams, Esq., of Norristown, Pa., is in the Metropolitan
  Museum of Art of New York (Plate <a href="#p11">11</a>, opp. Page
  64). It is also one of the most interesting. In it are found
  Persian, Armenian, Caucasian, and Mongolian characteristics,
  which serve to determine the district where it was woven and to
  suggest its age. Its Sehna knot, cotton warp and weft, as well as
  much of the drawing, are typical of Persia. The tri-cleft leaf
  and stem seen in the two lower corners, in the main stripe, and
  in parts of the field are found in almost all Armenian rugs. The
  reciprocal sawtooth of the outer border stripe and the geometric
  inner stripe are Caucasian features. Certain colour tones, the
  octagonal discs at each end of the large central palmettes, and
  more particularly the tendrils or scrolls of the main stripe of
  the border which resemble the foliate forms as they appear in
  Chinese rugs and porcelains of the late Ming and Kang-hi periods,
  are Mongolian. The combination of these characteristics indicates
  that it was made in the most northwesterly part of Persia where
  in 1258 Hulaku Khan established his capital, and his successors
  ruled for over a century. Here undoubtedly the craft of weaving
  flourished for a long period, and exercised an important
  influence on the surrounding countries. To judge by the colours;
  the formal character of the border; the rigid lines of the large
  palmette motives of the field, which are not seen in carpets of a
  much later period; and the stiff, archaic character of the bushes
  with foliage and blossoms arranged mechanically on the thick
  trunks, it is not unreasonable to place this piece as early as
  the middle of the XIV Century, during the interval between the
  overthrow of the Seljukian dynasty by the followers of Genghis
  Khan and the later invasion of the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>Timurids. In fact, it may be
  even older, since those graceful lines that belong to the highest
  art of a subsequent period are entirely lacking. But in the
  drawing is strength, and in the colours, a few of which have
  faded, are beauty and harmony.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 16. Persian Animal

  </div>

  <p>Such old pieces are very rare, yet a similar one, belonging to
  Prof. W. Bode, is in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin. Its
  drawing is more regular, and the trunks of the trees are broader.
  These two carpets represent the art of weaving at a very early
  period.</p>

  <p>Of equal interest and higher artistic merit is another carpet
  (Plate <a href="#p12">12</a>, opp. Page 68), belonging to C. F.
  Williams, Esq., and at present in the Metropolitan Museum of Art
  but formerly in the possession of J. B&ouml;hler of Munich. It
  has a length of nearly seventeen feet and a breadth of nearly
  twelve. There are about three hundred knots to the square inch.
  Though much of that stiffness of drawing found in the earlier
  pieces remains, the more pliant branches and less regular setting
  of the flowers indicate a later date; so that it is not
  improbable that it was woven about the first of the XV Century.
  Dr. Martin regards this piece as one of the oldest of the Timurid
  period if not from the Mongolian, and says that the trees
  resemble those in a Mongolian miniature in the Mus&eacute;e des
  Arts Decoratifs in Paris, and in a manuscript from the year 1396.
  At any rate, they display more formal drawing than the trees of
  more recent carpets. The character of pattern and the colouring
  suggest that it was woven in Northwestern Persia.</p>

  <p>The field is skilfully divided into three subfields by beds of
  flowers, from which slender trees rise and partly screen from
  view more stately cypresses. The subdivisions are further
  indicated by pairs of palmettes, of which the upper pair mark a
  transition between the lower pair and those more elegant forms
  commonly seen two centuries later. There are likewise palmettes
  of simpler form in the two guard stripes. But the principal
  ornamentation of the rich border is the interlacing arabesques of
  three different colours, which are decorated with a slender
  wreath of leaf and flower. There is, moreover, a particular
  interest in the grouping of the arabesques since they form a
  design which may be the prototype of the so-called turtle borders
  so frequently seen in Feraghans and Gorevans, and is itself
  derived, according to Dr. Martin, from a still older form in
  which branching arabesques extend across the whole field. It may
  not be unreasonable to assume that this pattern has<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span> been
  handed down from that earlier period when a Saracenic influence
  was felt in all the weavings.</p>

  <p>If the chief interest in this piece is centred in the pattern,
  its greatest charm lies in its soft, dainty colours, some of
  which are exquisitely beautiful. They are expressed in delicate
  shades of orange, ivory, light green, sable brown, and light and
  dark blue on a background of pinkish red. This pattern and
  colouring suggest an Eastern wood when the first frost of autumn
  has left its touch on the leaves. The border contains the same
  colours as the field but is strong and effective, since the soft
  tones are in the narrow guard stripes and the deeper colours
  appear in the broad central stripe in larger masses and in
  immediate contact.</p>

  <p>If this carpet was woven about 1400 <span class="smcap">a.
  d.</span>, as seems not improbable, the drawing of the trees,
  palmettes, and border designs becomes by comparison an important
  guide for determining the age of other antique Persian
  carpets.</p>

  <p>Very different, indeed, from the preceding is a woollen piece
  (Plate <a href="#p13">13</a>, opp. Page 70), sixteen feet four
  inches long by eleven feet two inches wide, that was formerly in
  the collection of Mr. Vincent Robinson of London, but is now in
  the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, which bought it at the
  Yerkes sale in 1910, for $19,600. It has about six hundred knots
  to the square inch, and is woven with warp of cotton and silk,
  and with weft of silk. The pile is velvety, and the texture,
  drawing, and colouring display a high grade of artistic
  craftsmanship. Another of similar character is represented in the
  Vienna Publication of Oriental Carpets of 1889, at which time it
  belonged to the Countess Clotilde Clam-Gallas of Vienna; and a
  third belongs to the Palais de Commerce at Lyons.</p>

  <p>In no other rugs from Iran is the effect of Mongolian
  tradition on design more noticeable; but that this was due to the
  Timurid invasion at the end of the XIV Century is doubtful, and
  it is not improbable that more immediate intervention with China
  determined the motives. Nor is the Saracenic influence obscured,
  since in every part of the field and border is seen the perfect
  rhythm of graceful arabesques. Such carpets represent, in fact,
  the transition from those earlier pieces to the higher products
  of Persian looms.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 17. So-called
    Polish Or Polonaise Carpet in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
    New York</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>One of the simplest ways of studying the pattern is to regard
  it as consisting of a number of units formed by a large rounded
  octagon encircled by eight heart-shaped escutcheons, and with a
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id=
  "Page_81">81</a></span>smaller rounded octagon at the centre of
  the diagonal lines connecting them. On the large octagons, which
  are of dark blue crossed by narrow bands of sable brown, is
  represented the fight of dragon and ph&oelig;nix so common in the
  ornamentation of the Ming dynasty; and in the smaller octagons,
  which are plum colour, are four running lions in red, blue, and
  green. The eight escutcheons alternate in crimson and blue, and
  have arabesques and Chinese ducks. The large pentagonal-shaped
  areas of the ivory field are covered with a most symmetrically
  drawn tracery of tendrils and flowers in red, yellow, and blue;
  and in the smaller hexagonal-shaped areas are cloud bands of
  similar colours.</p>

  <p>The border shows a marked advance over that of the preceding
  piece. The main stripe, which follows a pattern that with slight
  modification is adopted in many of the carpets of this and a
  later period, consists of a chain-like series of octagons similar
  to those of the field, separating elongated panels with crenated
  edges. The latter are adorned with cloud bands in yellow
  interlaced with delicate tendrils supporting flowers in red,
  yellow, green, and white, on a dark blue field; and surrounding
  them on a red ground is also a delicate tracery of leaves and
  flowers. The outer and inner stripes have arabesques and tendrils
  bearing flowers in red, green, and blue on a ground of golden
  yellow. All the colours of both field and border have mellowed
  into rich, beautiful hues in which is the most perfect
  harmony.</p>

  <p>The intricacy and character of design, the delicacy of
  drawing, and the tones of colour indicate that this piece was
  woven near the beginning of the Safavid dynasty, in the early
  part of the XVI Century. Mr. Robinson ascribes its origin to
  Bagdad; but it seems far more probable that it came from the
  northwestern part of Persia, which was an important centre of
  textile art only a few years later. This piece and the two others
  described on the pages just preceding are among the most
  interesting carpets now existing; for they represent not only a
  very high standard of the textile craft, but also most important
  steps in its development.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence to indicate how early animal carpets were
  woven in Persia. Dr. Martin found a piece with archaic drawing,
  that from its resemblance to an old tile of established age, he
  placed at about the year 1300 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>;
  but it was about the beginning of the XVI Century that were woven
  the first of those masterly pieces which displayed animals
  surrounded by a maze of floral life. Lions,<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span> leopards,
  boars, deer, and hounds were the principal motives. To each of
  these was ascribed some principle or quality, so that it has been
  assumed that the aim of the weaver was to give expression to some
  theme of interest.</p>

  <p>A number of these carpets represent the chase and are called
  &ldquo;Hunting Carpets.&rdquo; The best of them are regarded by
  Dr. Martin as belonging to the latter half of the XVI Century for
  reasons indicated in the following extract from his work:
  &ldquo;The manuscript of Nizami, one of the pearls of the British
  Museum, which was executed in Tabriz 1539-1542 for the Shah
  Tamasp, has the most wonderful designs on the margins. Although
  the manuscripts and the miniatures are signed by Persia&rsquo;s
  most renowned masters, there is nothing to give a hint as to who
  has drawn these magnificent borders. This manuscript, which at
  the time it was written, was considered one of the most
  remarkable &lsquo;the like of which the eye of time never
  beheld,&rsquo; plainly proves that the large carpets with hunting
  scenes must be relegated to a later time or to about 1560-1570.
  Both animals and trees are of a far more stately and earlier
  character in the manuscript.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One of the best of these pieces with animals (Plate <a href=
  "#p14">14</a>, opp. Page 72) is in the Metropolitan Museum of
  Art, in New York, by which it was purchased at the Yerkes sale in
  1910, for $15,200. It has a length of ten feet eleven inches with
  a breadth of five feet ten inches, and an average of four hundred
  and eighty knots to the square inch. Both warp and weft are of
  silk, and the pile is of wool. As it was confidently believed by
  Mr. Edward Stebbing<a name="FNanchor_12" id=
  "FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
  that this piece belonged for a long time to the Mosque of
  Ardebil, where Ismael had established his capital, and from which
  Tamasp subsequently moved; it is not improbable that it belongs
  to the early period, between the closing years of Ismael&rsquo;s
  reign and the first part of the reign of Tamasp.<a name=
  "FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class=
  "fnanchor">13</a> Nor is there anything in the technique of
  colour or design to convey a different impression, as the general
  colour of the field is a claret red, and that of the border a
  dark blue characteristic of this period.</p>

  <p>The most noticeable feature of the carpet is the display of
  animal life amid the carefully balanced arrangement of floral
  figures. Four-fifths of the field can be divided into two perfect
  squares with sides equal to the breadth of the field; and the
  remainder will be equiva<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83"
  id="Page_83">83</a></span>lent to one-half of one of these
  squares. Each quarter of a square contains animals, probably
  intended to represent a lion, leopard, and boar, that are
  perfectly balanced with those of the adjacent and alternating
  quarters. Moreover, the same balance exists in the case of the
  smaller animals and floral forms. Thus it appears that each
  square forms a perfect unit in which is shown a remarkable
  relation between all parts. Such mathematical exactness indicates
  the highest artistic skill. The repetition of pattern also
  accentuates the predominant idea of animal life, which is
  rendered even more noticeable by the strong golden yellow of some
  of the group. Whoever has studied the early Iranian monuments
  remembers with how slight variation some of the drawing has been
  copied during subsequent generations; so that it is not
  surprising that Mr. Stebbing should call attention to the
  resemblance of some of the animals in this carpet to those of the
  rock-carved sculptures of Tak-i-Bostan near Kermanshah.</p>

  <p>As is the case with most modern Persian rugs, there is no
  correspondence between the size of the animals and the flowers.
  Nevertheless the lack of harmony is not felt, as the animal and
  the floral life are intended to be regarded separately. The
  principal flowers of the field are peonies, some of which are
  woven with silver threads. They also appear in the border
  arranged with perfect precision within the folds of symmetrical
  cloud-bands and interlacing arabesques. The latter form a
  well-executed repetitive figure that suggests an origin for the
  reciprocal trefoil or lily pattern, as it is sometimes called,
  which received its highest development in the silk rugs of a
  later century.</p>

  <p>On the whole, this piece is not far short of the highest
  sumptuary standard of a subsequent period, and is an excellent
  example of the artistic development of the earliest part of the
  Safavid dynasty. In few other carpets is combined such intricacy
  of design with richness and simplicity of colour.</p>

  <p>Of still greater interest than the last is the Arbedil Carpet,
  now in the South Kensington Museum. It has a length of
  thirty-four and a half feet with a breadth of seventeen and a
  half; the texture shows about three hundred and twenty-five knots
  to the square inch; and the pile is of wool tied to warp and weft
  of silk. It has been very carefully studied by Mr. Edward
  Stebbing, from whose description the following extracts are
  taken:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The body ground is blue, covered with a floral tracery
  of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id=
  "Page_84">84</a></span> exquisite delicacy and freedom of
  treatment. A central medallion of pale yellow terminates on its
  outer edge in sixteen minaret-shaped points from which spring
  sixteen cartouches; four green, four red, and eight light cream;
  and from two of these again, as it were, suspended and hanging in
  the direction of the respective ends of the carpet, two of the
  sacred lamps of the mosque.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quarter sections of the central medallion also on a
  pale yellow ground, relieved by tracery, form the angles; while a
  broader border completes the glorious design, a border of the
  alternate elongated and rounded cartouches filled with floral and
  other tracery, the former on a base of red, the latter on a rich
  brown ground flanked on the inner side by a broad band of cream
  seven inches wide, relieved by a variation of a so-called cloud
  pattern, and a narrower band of crimson near the body of the
  carpet; and on the outer side by a single broad band, also seven
  inches wide, of tawny hue, shading from dark to light, and
  relieved by a bold design in blue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But however exquisite the tracery, however delicate the
  colouring, the greatest interest centres in the fact that in a
  panel adjoining the border of the upper end is the following
  inscription:</p>

  <div class="poem2">
    <div class="stanza2">
      <span class="i02">&ldquo;I have no refuge in the world other
      than thy threshold;</span> <span class="i02">&ldquo;My head
      has no protection other than thy porchway;</span>
      <span class="i02">&ldquo;The work of the slave of the holy
      place, Maksoud of Kashan, in the year 946.&rdquo;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here is revealed the age of the carpet, which not only
  determines the character of workmanship of a particular period,
  but affords a standard for determining by comparison the relative
  age of other pieces. The year 946 corresponds with our year 1540
  A. D., and the position of the date indicates that it was
  inscribed a little before the completion of the fabric.
  Accordingly, it would not be unreasonable to assume that the
  carpet was begun during the closing years of the reign of Ismael,
  who died at Ardebil in 1524, and that it was finished during the
  reign of Tamasp I.</p>

  <p>To infer that at this period were many such carpets would be a
  mistake; since this was doubtless woven by the order of the
  court, and by one of the most skilled artisans, who may have made
  it the crowning labour of his life. It indicates the highest
  technique acquired in the early part of the Safavid dynasty.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Besides the mosque carpets, other pieces such as small prayer
  rugs were used for devotional purposes. When the first of them
  were made is unknown, though they existed in the days of the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id=
  "Page_85">85</a></span>Caliphs, when the words of the Prophet
  were still fresh in the memories of his followers; and they were
  also used at an early period among Turkomans. The oldest that
  remain belong to the early part of the Safavid rule. One that was
  formerly in the collection of Stefano Bardini of Florence and is
  now owned by Mr. Benjamin Altman, appeared at the exhibit of the
  Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1910. It is a woollen piece with a
  length of nearly five and a half feet and a breadth of three and
  a quarter. In the central field is a prayer arch resembling some
  of a later period, with outlines gracefully recurving near the
  base and broken on each side by a pentagonal-shaped flower. All
  parts of each of the two trees that rise from the bottom of the
  field are reversely duplicated in the other. Some of the
  stiffness of drawing of the earlier carpets remains, but the
  blossoms are clustered more naturally and the whole treatment is
  more skilful. The effect of the scroll-work on the red ground of
  the spandrel; of the suspended lamp with its bright flowers of
  red, yellow, and pink; and of the blossoming trees beneath, is
  most pleasing; but the chief interest centres in the outer border
  stripe, where appear features that are more interesting than
  harmonious, features derived from Persia, Assyria, Mongolia, and
  Arabia. The rounded octagons have Cufic lettering that recalls
  early Mesopotamian civilisation; the cartouches at the bottom
  with their cloud-bands suggest Mongolian conquests; and the upper
  cartouches contain the following verses from the Koran:</p>

  <div class="poem2">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i02">&ldquo;Iman the victorious and expected
      Mahdi, the Lord of the Age.</span> <span class="i02">Zalsi
      and Hason; and bless the standing proof.</span> <span class=
      "i02">Oh Lord bless Mohammed the chosen one. Ali, the elect,
      Fatimeh the Immaculate.</span> <span class="i02">Jofer Sadik,
      Mooza Kazin, Ali Riza Mohammed Taki, Mohammed Nakee,
      Ali.</span> <span class="i02">The two branches Harson and
      Hussein Bless Ali Zaimulubbad Mohammed
      Bak&rsquo;r.&rdquo;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These verses, the archaic lamp, and the green of the field, a
  colour sacred to Moslems, all indicate the religious character of
  the carpet. Similar features also appear in another antique piece
  of about the same age, but the Cufic characters of the border are
  within squares surrounded by circles that resemble Chinese seals
  as they appear in early manuscripts. Both of these pieces were
  probably woven in Northwestern Persia about the middle of the XVI
  Century. Few such prayer carpets remain, though without doubt
  they were used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id=
  "Page_86">86</a></span> by devotees during succeeding periods,
  and it is not unusual to see, even in modern Kermanshahs, prayer
  arches of the same pattern.</p>

  <p>Of totally different character but of about the same age is an
  animal rug (Plate <a href="#p15">15</a>, opp. Page 76) that
  belongs to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was bought at the
  Yerkes sale in 1910, for $5,600, and had previously belonged to
  the collection of Vincent Robinson of London. It has a length of
  about seven and a half feet with a breadth of about five and a
  half, and consists of woollen pile tied to cotton warp crossed by
  woollen weft. The weave is not unlike what is seen in many modern
  Sarouks; as the knot is Sehna, one thread of warp is doubled
  under the other in each knot, and the coloured thread of weft,
  which crosses twice, is partly exposed at the back.</p>

  <p>Like so many of the old Persian pieces, the ground colour of
  red appears in the main field, and is strongly contrasted with
  the dark blue of the medallion and dark green of the corners. Red
  and green also appear in the border contrasted with yellow. This
  association of colour is not usual, nor is the repetitive pattern
  of the border with its sharp cusps at many of the angles, nor the
  trapeziform corners, and the nearly rectangular medallion.
  Likewise the mechanically formed bushes with their quince-like
  fruit, on which sit birds of disproportionate size, show a
  departure from the accepted traditions of the Safavid schools.
  Yet these very features awaken new interest, and suggest that it
  was probably woven in some part of Northern or Western Persia
  where the influence of the court was not paramount. Nevertheless
  the accurate balance of the different halves, and the drawing of
  the palmettes show that it is distinctly Iranian.</p>

  <p>If this last piece be compared with the animal rug (Plate
  <a href="#p16">16</a>, opp. Page 78) that was presented to the
  Metropolitan Museum of Art by Mr. Cochran, the wide contrast will
  at once be noticeable. As the latter has a length of about eight
  and two-thirds feet with a breadth of nearly six, the difference
  in size and proportions is not great; nor is there any particular
  difference in the number of animals; nor in the balanced relation
  of upper and lower, right and left halves; nor in the red ground
  of the main fields. But here the resemblance ends. Whereas in the
  former the animals are one of the most prominent features, in the
  latter they are subordinate to the rich assemblage of floral and
  palmette forms, that occupy not only the field but also the
  border. It is, indeed, a piece that marks <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>a
  transition from the animal rugs, so prominent in the early part
  of the XVI Century but rarely woven later than its end, to the
  more elegant pieces, so characteristic of the court of Ispahan,
  which belong almost exclusively to the XVII Century. It
  accordingly seems not without reason to assign it to about the
  year 1600.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 19. Armenian Carpet
    in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>Not only do these different elements that denote a transition
  add interest; they also give a most pleasing effect. The main
  border stripe of a rich green with its well-drawn palmettes
  surrounded by vines and foliated stalks, on which rest naturally
  drawn birds of handsome plumage, and the chaste floral designs of
  the narrow guards, serve as a tasteful frame to the central
  picture. Here again the outer field, with artistic effect, brings
  into greater relief the central medallion, where on a ground of
  greenish yellow, standing and seated amidst blossoming shrubs in
  red, blue, and green, as in a garden, are richly dressed human
  forms. Apart from these, yet perhaps intended in some way to
  reflect the tenor of their thoughts, are four ducks, emblematic
  of matrimonial happiness. Whatever may have been the original
  shade of the central medallion, it is now slightly out of harmony
  with the surrounding colours, and is perhaps the only jarring
  note in this exquisite piece of workmanship. Not improbably the
  present shade is due to the unfriendly hand of time, since the
  artistic genius of the weaver is fully displayed in the masterly
  arrangement of other colours and in the delicacy and precision of
  the drawing of the perfectly balanced floral and animal
  forms.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of determining the locality where the antique
  carpets were woven is often greater than in the case of modern
  rugs, but this piece was probably one of the last of those fine
  old animal carpets that were woven in the northwestern part of
  Persia.</p>

  <p>Though modern silk rugs fail to awaken the interest of woollen
  pieces, the old silk carpets were formerly regarded as the
  choicest products of weaving. As a rule, they were the work of
  the most skilled artists employed in the imperial factory under
  the direction and patronage of the court. It was during the reign
  of Shah Tamasp that they received special attention. Following a
  custom that had been in vogue of sending carpets as presents to
  foreign courts, in 1566 he sent to the Sultan of Constantinople a
  number of pieces on which flowers, birds, and animals were woven
  with silk on threads of gold. But it was doubtless after his
  successor Shah Abbas I had begun to embellish his capital at
  Ispahan, that were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id=
  "Page_88">88</a></span> made the famous &ldquo;Polish&rdquo; silk
  or &ldquo;Polonaise&rdquo; carpets about which there has been so
  much controversy. It is true that Mr. Robinson in his
  &ldquo;Eastern Carpets&rdquo; claims that they were woven in
  Poland by Persians taken there by a Pole named Mersherski; but it
  seems far more probable that they were woven under the
  supervision of the Persian court and were either sent as presents
  to European sovereigns or purchased by wealthy connoisseurs of
  art.</p>

  <p>How many of these pieces may be hidden away in the palaces and
  mosques of the far East it is impossible to determine, but two
  hundred would be a very conservative estimate of the number owned
  by the different courts of Europe and by private collectors of
  that country and America. One of them was presented to the Danish
  court as late as 1639; and it is believed that all that reached
  Europe arrived there between the years 1604 and 1650.</p>

  <p>Their beauty is exquisite and chaste. To the threads of silver
  and gold is tied silken nap that often displays a striking
  brilliancy. Unlike the earlier Persian carpets which had more
  subdued hues, these pieces have light tones such as salmon, rose,
  and green, which are arranged with perfect harmony. Moreover,
  there is an elegance of design representing the highest types of
  Iranian, Saracenic, and Mongolian influences combined. Here in
  perfection are dainty floral forms, the rhythmic tracery of
  arabesques, and delicate cloud-bands. In them the textile art of
  the East reached a perfection that probably has never been
  surpassed.</p>

  <p>One of these (Plate <a href="#p17">17</a>, opp. Page 80), that
  has a length of about nine feet and a breadth of five and a half,
  belongs to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In many respects it is
  typical of its class, though threads of yellow and grey are
  substituted for the usual gold and silver of the foundation. On a
  field of rose are outlined palmettes, leaves, and scrolls in
  green, blue, brown, and salmon, that harmonise with the light
  blue of the border. All of these colours blend with pleasing
  effect and soften lines that in a print seem harsh. Furthermore
  with all its complexity of detail, every part of the pattern is
  arranged with mathematical precision. That a carpet with such
  perfect balance of every part, such intricacy of elaborate
  detail, such graceful curves of the heavy foliate leaves should
  be woven without copying some older pattern or a carefully
  executed drawing, seems improbable.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In this piece and in others of the same class can be
  recognised what is probably the prototype of more
  conventionalised and less <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89"
  id="Page_89">89</a></span>elegant designs so often seen in modern
  Persian pieces, since the palmette with encircling lancet leaves
  in its borders is most suggestive of the borders of modern
  Herats; and the rhomboidal-shaped figure connecting four
  palmettes at the centre is equally suggestive of the Herati or
  fish pattern seen in the field of innumerable Feraghans.</p>

  <p>It was also during the reign of Shah Abbas<a name=
  "FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class=
  "fnanchor">14</a> and his immediate successors that most of the
  so-called Ispahans were woven, though some of them appeared as
  early as the XV and some as late as the close of the XVII
  Century. As in the case with the Polish silk carpets, within
  recent years some difference of opinion has existed regarding the
  place of their manufacture. After careful research, Dr. Martin
  believes that they came from Herat and with this idea some other
  authorities concur. It is true that Herat belonged to the Persian
  Empire during the reign of the Safavid dynasty, and that even in
  the days of Shah Ismael magnificent carpets were woven there. It
  is also true that during the time of Tamasp and Abbas it was as
  important an art centre as Tabriz, and that the weaving of
  carpets was a leading industry there. Furthermore, there has not
  been found the same evidence to show that Ispahan was at this
  period an equally important centre of weaving. On the other hand,
  it is well known that the splendid industrial and art products of
  this period were largely due to the direct encouragement and
  favour of the court, and that the court was for most of the time
  at Ispahan. It is also known that skilled artisans were
  repeatedly removed from one district to another at the command of
  a sovereign, so that carpets of similar character might be woven
  contemporaneously in remote parts of Persia. It accordingly seems
  not improbable that the original type of these carpets was
  evolved at Herat and that many of them at least were made at
  Herat, but that others were also made at Ispahan. At any rate
  they were made to a great extent under the influence that
  emanated from Ispahan.</p>

  <p>Almost without exception they are pieces of large size and
  oblong shape. The ground colour of the field is usually red, the
  border blue; but blue is occasionally used in the field and green
  in the border. Their distinguishing feature is the use of the
  palmette, that was probably derived from the lotus, so frequently
  associated with the Buddhist cult of India and China. In the
  field it generally <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id=
  "Page_90">90</a></span> occurs in pairs that slightly vary in
  size. Of almost equal importance are the Chinese cloud-bands and
  the scrolls or arabesques. These three designs were constant
  motives in almost all the Ispahans; but they were subject to
  modifications in size and shape, which appearing in chronological
  order furnish some guide to the time when the carpets were woven.
  For instance, the palmettes were at first small and distributed
  plentifully over the field; later they became larger, until in a
  few instances they were a yard in diameter. Dr. Martin says that
  in the first part of the XVII Century the palmettes began to be
  very large and the richness of the interior design to disappear;
  until at the end of the XVII Century only a few were sufficient
  to cover the ground that one hundred years before was almost
  hidden by innumerable designs of small palmettes, cloud-bands,
  and scroll work. He also states that towards the middle of the
  XVII Century the borders began to lose their importance and that
  the palmettes were surrounded by two long, narrow leaves.</p>

  <p>Though most of the antique Iranian carpets that remain were
  woven in the Northern provinces, it is well known that even from
  earliest times carpets of elaborate design and skilful technique
  were also woven in Southern Persia. In fact, many of the
  wonderful pieces that adorned the palaces and mosques of the
  Fatimid Caliphs of Egypt came from the districts of Fars and
  Kirman. The latter, notwithstanding invasions of Seljukian Turks,
  Mongolians, and Afghans, has continued almost uninterruptedly as
  a centre of the textile industry; yet comparatively few pieces
  exist that were woven there three or four centuries ago. Their
  colour scheme harmonises more with that of the carpets of Western
  Persia than with the more sombre tones of the old animal carpets
  and Ispahans, or with the brighter hues of the so-called Polish.
  Their patterns also show a distinction from those of northern
  textile fabrics. The fields are often artificially divided, by
  foliate stalks or lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, into
  rhomboidal figures that contain mechanically drawn shrubs,
  palmettes, or flowers. In the main stripe of the border are
  generally represented interlacing arabesques adorned with
  flowering vines or arabesques and a sub-pattern of vines.
  Mongolian designs are rarely seen in any of these pieces, which
  probably represent more closely than any other Persian carpets
  native art unaffected by foreign influences. Almost all of them
  are now owned in Europe.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id=
  "Page_91">91</a></span>Of the early rugs, those woven in Armenia
  are far less known than those from Persia. Nevertheless, it may
  reasonably be assumed that the high culture that was manifested
  in Bagdad and Ctesiphon during the sway of the Caliphs was felt
  among the mountainous districts to the north; and that the
  Seljukian rulers, who left such artistic monuments in the old
  Armenian capitals, appreciated and encouraged the manufacture of
  fine woollen fabrics. In fact, Marco Polo, who travelled through
  that region during the latter part of the XIII Century, referred
  to them as being remarkably handsome.</p>

  <p>Probably the oldest remaining pieces are the so-called Dragon
  carpets, which, it is believed, were produced from the XIV to the
  XVII Century and possibly even earlier. Not infrequently the
  length is at least twice the breadth; the very narrow border
  occasionally consists of only a single stripe; and the field is
  occupied by a trellis-like pattern of narrow, conventionalised
  leaves, within which are designs containing archaic flowers and
  dragons. The ground colour of the field is generally some shade
  of red, that of the border white, and the leaves are yellow,
  blue, or green. In the borders of many of them appear an S motive
  from which undoubtedly was derived the design so frequently seen
  in panels of more recent Asia Minor prayer rugs.</p>

  <p>In the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York is a XV Century
  carpet (Plate <a href="#p19">19</a>, opp. Page 86), which, though
  widely differing from these pieces in general pattern, so closely
  resembles them in the essential characteristics of weave and
  colour that it is unquestionably of the same class. The field is
  occupied by concentric diamonds with stepped sides. The
  encircling bands, that are mostly red, yellow, and violet, and
  the corners, that are white, contain numerous archaic forms,
  including palmettes, trees, birds, and animals. There are also
  numerous small designs of the tri-cleft leaf so common to the
  Circassian and Soumak rugs; and the ray-like edges of the central
  lozenge, as well as the four palmettes that rest upon it, suggest
  the origin of the effulgent stars of old Daghestans and
  Kabistans. An effort has been made to balance similar designs in
  corresponding parts of the field, though its centre is at one
  side of the geometric centre of the diamonds. The palmettes show
  distinctly a strong Persian influence and the animal forms
  likewise show that it was not woven by a sectarian Sunnite of
  Western Asia Minor.</p>

  <p>Part of a very unusual carpet (Plate <a href="#p20">20</a>,
  opp. Page 88), from a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id=
  "Page_92">92</a></span> district in Eastern Asia Minor, is in the
  Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin. Its principal interest lies in
  the fact that it is very old and that its approximate age has
  been determined. In the hospital at Siena, Italy, a similar rug
  is represented in a fresco called the &ldquo;Wedding of the
  Foundling,&rdquo; painted by Domenico di Bartolo about the year
  1440, so that it is reasonable to conclude that this particular
  piece was woven not much later. In fact, its character would
  indicate that it or some other from which it has been copied was
  much older. Each of the nearly square compartments contain
  octagons, within which on a yellow field are represented the
  mythical fight of the dragon and ph&oelig;nix that was adopted as
  the Ming coat of arms. It is interesting to note that the chain
  pattern of the brownish-black main border stripe is not unlike
  what is seen in modern pieces, but the running latch hooks of the
  corners and the small S designs are unusually stiff. This
  disposition to formal drawing, which is conspicuous in all parts
  of the rug, shows an archaic style noticeable only in the very
  earliest carpets.</p>

  <p>In the celebrated painting of Georg Gyze (Plate <a href=
  "#p21">21</a>, opp. Page 92) which hangs in the Berlin Gallery,
  is represented a rug of a class so frequently seen in the
  paintings of Hans Holbein that they are known as &ldquo;Holbein
  rugs.&rdquo; Their marked dissimilarity to those previously
  described indicates that they were woven under different
  circumstances if not in different regions. Neither in the fields
  nor borders is any trace of Mongolian or Persian influences; and
  the absence of all floral, leaf, and animal forms so usual in
  most antique carpets is noticeable. Indeed, the fact that animal
  forms rarely appear in the art of the Sunni Mohammedans aids in
  determining the place of their origin. They came from Asia Minor
  or Western Armenia.</p>

  <p>It has generally been assumed that they were woven in Western
  Asia Minor, because they were purchased there in former centuries
  and taken thence to Europe; but they possess many features that
  indicate they may have been woven farther to the east, whence
  many could easily have been transported westward in caravans.
  Their borders contain the well-known pattern derived from Cufic
  letters which, more conventionalised, appears in later years only
  in such rugs as the Kabistans and Daghestans of Eastern Caucasia.
  Most of them also contain the small octagonal discs and larger
  octagonal figures with Greek crosses at the centre that suggest
  forcibly the designs of Southeastern Caucasia. The narrow stripes
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id=
  "Page_93">93</a></span>of ribbon and chain pattern found in many
  of them also are very common in Caucasian rugs; so that it seems
  not improbable that these Holbein rugs were made within the
  boundaries of that greater Armenia which, embracing the upper
  Mesopotamian valley, extended over the eastern part of Asia Minor
  and the southern part of modern Caucasia.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 21. Portrait of
    Georg Gyze by Hans Holbein, Showing a Holbein Rug With Cufic
    Border</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>These rugs claim the attention not only because they have
  borders of such interesting origin, but by the fact that the age
  when they were woven is ascertainable. As Holbein lived between
  the years 1497 and 1543, and some other rugs of this type appear
  in the works of early Flemish and Italian painters, it may
  reasonably be assumed that some of them were made before the end
  of the XV Century.</p>

  <p>A very excellent example of this class, owned by Mr. C. F.
  Williams, is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It has a
  length of about five feet with a breadth of three and a half. The
  ground colour of the field is an olive green and that of the main
  stripe of the border is red. The prevailing colours of the
  designs, which are entirely geometric, are blue, green, and
  ivory. All of these rugs are small or of moderate size, and are
  slightly oblong. Some of them have a ground colour of green; and
  yellow is frequently found in the pattern. The weaving is rather
  loose; and compared with Persian rugs they have fewer knots to
  the square inch.</p>

  <p>Another carpet from Asia Minor that also belongs to Mr. C. F.
  Williams appears in Plate <a href="#p22">22</a>, opp. Page 94. It
  is the only entire rug with this pattern that is known, though a
  piece of a similar rug is in the Victoria and Albert Museum at
  London. On fields of blue and red are outlined three large
  four-pointed stars separated by smaller diamonds. Within these
  figures and in the surrounding field is a network of tracery
  supporting conventionalised leaf and floral forms. Between the
  field and the main stripe of the narrow border is a close
  co-ordination of pattern, but the simple ribbon of the inner
  guard seems alien. It appears without modification in many later
  Asia Minor and Caucasian rugs.</p>

  <p>An important feature are the double knots at the corners of
  the stars, since they are identical with designs found in a
  manuscript made for one of the Shahs in 1435, and thus assist to
  determine the age of the rug. For this reason and on account of
  its general character, it seems not unreasonable to place it as
  early as the middle of the XV Century.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id=
  "Page_94">94</a></span>Similar carpets were woven during a long
  period, and it is probable that in the latter half of the
  following century they were largely influenced by the weavers
  that Solyman the Magnificent, after capturing Tabriz in 1534,
  transported to his own country. The same general features still
  remained, but the detail was more elaborate and ornate.
  Arabesques, palmettes, and floral forms, both of field and
  border, resembled more nearly the Iranian character. But at a
  later period, after the beginning of the general decadence to
  which every industry and art were subject, the patterns became
  much simpler, and the colours were reduced almost exclusively to
  red and blue with a little green. At length, both pattern and
  colours assumed the type of modern Oushaks, that by a slow
  process of devolution originated from these antique pieces.</p>

  <p>In Armenia and Asia Minor it is probable that weaving existed
  before the Christian era, and that the earliest carpets which
  remain, though affected by more eastern influences, are largely
  the product of an indigenous art. But in India it was otherwise.
  It is true that Sir George Birdwood is authority for the
  statement that the Saracens introduced carpet-weaving there; but
  it is most probable that at the time of the invasion of the
  armies of Tamerlane and during the lives of many of his
  successors, whatever carpets were woven were very crude. Even
  when the Moguls began to build and embellish palaces, they
  obtained their carpets from Persia. But at length Shah Akbar
  established manufacturies at Lahore about the year 1580, and
  invited Persian weavers to settle there. From them the native
  workmen acquired much of their knowledge of patterns and
  technique.</p>

  <p>It was during the reign of Shah Jahan (1628-1658), builder of
  the famous peacock throne and Taj Mahal, that most of the
  choicest pieces that now remain were woven. In delicacy of
  texture they rival those of any other country, and it is not
  unusual to find pieces with nearly eight hundred knots to the
  square inch; moreover, all their designs are depicted with
  remarkable clearness of definition. One of the most noted of
  these carpets is the woollen piece, about eight yards long by two
  and a half wide, that was made at the royal factory at Lahore and
  presented to the Girdlers Company of London in 1634. The mingling
  of leaf and floral forms, as well as the Herati designs of
  rosette and crumpled leaf, on a field of red, shows unmistakably
  its relation to Persian carpets. At the same period were woven
  large numbers of others with fields covered <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>with an
  imposing display of superbly drawn flowers, of which every part
  from root to leaf tips was represented with astonishing realism.
  Another class included the animal or hunting carpets, which
  unlike their Persian prototypes seem intended not so much to
  portray symbolically some historic event or abstract idea, as to
  convey a correct impression of an actual event.</p>

  </div>

  <p>One of these, a woollen piece with a length of eight and a
  quarter feet and a breadth of five and a quarter, is in the
  Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The inspiration was from some old
  Persian piece, but the rendering is peculiarly Indian. In this
  representation of an Oriental jungle is a strange mingling of the
  real and unreal. The struggle of a monster bird with a winged
  beast, half lion, half elephant, and the demoniac faces of the
  border suggest the inspiration of early pagan mythology; but the
  movements of the running gazelles and the stealthily creeping
  tiger, the attitude of the driver of the cart and his attendant,
  are most natural. The drawing as a whole is exceedingly delicate.
  The ground colour of the field is the red of most Ispahans and
  Herats of this period, but the border is a cream colour, a
  combination not in accord with Persian tradition. The other
  colours are fawn, blue, pink, grey and brown. It is probably the
  only Indian hunting carpet of its kind.</p>

  <p>Few strictly antique carpets from other countries of the
  Orient are known. Of the innumerable pieces that were surely
  woven in Caucasia and Western Turkestan before the end of the
  XVII Century, scarcely a vestige can be found. Nor are there many
  from the looms of Syria, though in the days of the Caliphs every
  mosque was adorned with magnificent carpets. It is true a few
  sterling pieces of Saracenic character, that have been ascribed
  to the region about Damascus, still exist. There are also a few
  rare and beautiful pieces that have come to light in
  China.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> But of the countless
  thousands that in almost every country of the Orient once covered
  floors of palaces and mosques, representing one of the most
  refined arts, now nearly lost, only an insignificant fraction
  remains.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

  <h4>CLASSIFICATION OF MODERN RUGS</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/r.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="R"
  title="R" /></span>UGS contribute to the comfort of the nomad
  more than any other fabric. With them he closes the entrance to
  his tent or covers the floor and couches on which he sits and
  sleeps. Thrown over other objects they form the table, made into
  saddle bags they take the place of trunks. The followers of Islam
  when at prayer kneel on a rug, and in token of affection spread
  one over the grave of a friend. To dwellers in cities, also, rugs
  contribute largely to the comfort and luxury of the home. Indeed,
  without them the splendour of Oriental life would seem
  incomplete, since they are the principal furnishings of every
  house, where stout woven pieces with long pile are spread as
  floor coverings, and lighter ones are hung as porti&egrave;res
  and tapestries. Yet it is in the assembly or dining hall that the
  finest rugs are used, though here the most valued are exposed
  only on great occasions.</p>

  <p>In the East a rug receives a particular name according to
  which of these special purposes it is adapted. The large, almost
  square piece that is used to cover the centre of the assembly
  hall is known as the &ldquo;Khali;&rdquo; and the narrow strips
  or &ldquo;runners&rdquo; that are placed at its sides and ends
  are known as the &ldquo;Kenares.&rdquo; It is on the Kenares that
  the servants are required to walk and the less honoured guests to
  stand, for they are rarely of such fine quality as the former.
  Before the divan, that generally surrounds three walls and is
  covered with fine cloth and velvet, are seats on which are placed
  carpets called &ldquo;Sedjadeh.&rdquo; They are nearly twice as
  long as broad, and since they are of moderate size and excellent
  quality they are frequently used for many other purposes. The
  hearth rug, termed &ldquo;Odjalik,&rdquo; can generally be
  distinguished from others, as each end of the field is of
  triangular shape with the apex at the extremity. However much any
  of these may be valued, the one that to every<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span> worshipper
  of Allah has the most sacred association is the
  &ldquo;Namazlik,&rdquo; or prayer rug, at one end of which is an
  arch in token of the mosque. At call for prayer the faithful
  Moslem spreads his rug with arch directed towards Mecca, and
  kneeling with the palms of his hands at each side of the centre
  he bows his head till it touches the rug. As the Mohammedans of
  Persia are unwilling that a Namazlik be trampled by the foot of
  an infidel, few from there can be bought; but the Mohammedans of
  other countries are less scrupulous, so that many of the prayer
  rugs sold in America have been made solely for trade and have
  never been used in worship. They may be beautiful, but special
  interest attaches to old pieces of which the well-worn nap shows
  where the knees of both father and son for over half a century
  have often pressed. In addition to these are other rugs with
  technical names, but a classification of much greater importance
  is that which depends on the country or district where they are
  woven.</p>

  <p>When the Oriental rugs first appeared in the market of the
  United States, they were spoken of as &ldquo;Turkish,&rdquo; for
  the reason that importers purchased them from Turkish merchants
  of Constantinople. But when it became known that they had been
  taken there by caravans from countries farther to the east, and
  that large numbers of them came from Persia, the name
  &ldquo;Persian,&rdquo; that to the mind of many conveys ideas of
  splendour, was at once applied; even to-day all classes of
  Oriental rugs are often spoken of as Persian. As objects of
  ornament or utility, their value is independent of their place of
  origin; yet it is known that the wool of the nap and the dyes
  used in some districts are superior to those in others, and that
  in consequence the beauty of some rugs will improve with age far
  more than that of others. It is also known that because in
  certain districts the material of warp and weft, as well as the
  workmanship, is of a superior quality, the rugs made there will
  wear better than others. The knowledge, then, of where a rug is
  made is important in determining the quality and value, which
  otherwise only a critical examination, that few people are able
  to make, would show.</p>

    Rug</span></p>

  <p>Furthermore, the knowledge of where a rug is made, suggesting
  the class of people who wove it, adds immeasurably to our
  interest. When, for instance, we look at an old piece of Kurdish
  weave with its nomadic designs and shaggy nap, on which a Moslem
  savage as an Apache often rested fully half a century ago, there
  is called up a picture of the dark-visaged tribesman, fearless
  and untamed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id=
  "Page_99">99</a></span>as were his ancestors who contested the
  march of Xenophon over two thousand years ago. We see him
  wandering with his flocks over the hills while he watches for a
  chance to fall upon an unsuspecting stranger. We picture to
  ourselves the hut of brush upon the mountain side where a slender
  barbaric girl bends to tie, with wonderful patience, the knots
  one by one. So if we would enjoy our Oriental rugs, we should
  know what people made them, and whence and how they journeyed,
  before they reached our fireside.</p>

  <p>At the request of a purchaser the vendor is ever ready to
  classify a rug, but his statements are not always reliable. This
  is partly due to the fact that even the great importing houses
  are often deceived. Throughout Asia Minor, Persia, Turkestan,
  even farther east, great fairs are regularly held. Here gather
  the representatives of tribes from far distant quarters to enjoy
  for a few days or weeks the gay life and abandon of the East
  while bartering the products of their different crafts. Here come
  the purchasing agents looking for rugs; and the pieces that may
  be brought from afar are bought and shipped by camel and rail to
  such great marts as Tabriz, Tiflis, and Constantinople, where the
  bales are unpacked and the rugs assorted, classified and
  labelled, before they are resold to the importing houses of
  Europe and America. Thus both in the buying from the itinerant
  agent of rugs assembled from different quarters and in the
  reassortment at the exporting cities there is frequent
  opportunity for errors of classification.</p>

  <p>The characteristics of the different groups and classes of
  rugs are given in later chapters, but it should not be presumed
  that these are infallible guides to the locality where they were
  made. Often a ruler, by fostering art, has drawn to his capital
  artists and artisans from other districts. Thus designs and
  quality of workmanship characteristic of one district would be
  adopted in another. So, too, the great caravans that pass along
  regular routes eastward and westward, and the annual pilgrimages
  to Meshed and Mecca, have been most potent influences for the
  dissemination of designs. Yet taking into consideration the
  general pattern and smaller designs; the material of warp, weft,
  and pile; the knot; the dyes; the finish of sides and ends, and
  the peculiarities of the weave, it is possible with a reasonable
  amount of certainty to determine in what districts almost all
  Oriental rugs are woven.</p>

  <p>It should be borne in mind, however, that the names by which
  some of the rugs are known in America are not the same as
  those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id=
  "Page_100">100</a></span> by which they are known in Asia. For
  instance, the rugs made by some of the tribes of the Tekke
  Khanate are known in the Orient as &ldquo;Tekkes;&rdquo; but as
  the great depot for Turkestan carpets was formerly the city of
  Bokhara, they are generally known in this country as
  &ldquo;Bokharas.&rdquo; On the other hand, there are local
  distinctions in the eastern countries not known in the western.
  The accompanying classification, therefore, is slightly
  arbitrary, but should be convenient for reference; since the
  classes represent the cities or districts where are woven the
  several different kinds, excepting the Chinese, which are divided
  chronologically. The names of the groups are not in each instance
  entirely satisfactory, but are probably the best that can be
  chosen. The fourth group, for example, has frequently been called
  the &ldquo;Turkoman;&rdquo; but as it includes some of the rugs
  of Afghanistan, and also those of Beluchistan, which is remote
  from Turkestan, that name is not sufficiently comprehensive. The
  district where these rugs are made is, strictly speaking, the
  western and southwestern part of Central Asia; but the term here
  employed has the authority of some German writers of note. So,
  too, the rugs of Herat, though it is now a city of Afghanistan,
  are included with the Persian group; but it should be remembered
  that Herat, as well as the districts of Mosul and Kurdistan, was
  once part of the old Persian Empire.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

  <h4>PERSIAN RUGS</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/i.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="I"
  title="I" /></span>N the grouping of Oriental rugs, it is not
  always desirable to follow the present political divisions of
  territory, since great and frequent changes in national
  boundaries have occurred without corresponding changes in the
  traditional style of weaving. Thus it happens that with the rugs
  made in Persia, which is still called Iran by its inhabitants, it
  is desirable to group those made within that former Iran that
  included the valley of Mesopotamia on the west and part of
  Afghanistan on the east. The woven products of all this territory
  have characteristics that are similar to one another and that
  differentiate them from those of other countries. Their patterns
  are distinctly floral, representing leaf, bud, and flower, and
  show a tendency to naturalistic drawing with graceful and often
  intricate lines. Moreover, their colour schemes of delicate tones
  are not only beautiful but in perfect harmony. In marked contrast
  with them are the rugs of Caucasia, Asia Minor, and Central Asia,
  which have patterns of geometric shape or highly conventionalised
  flower forms, and colours that often appear in bold contrast. In
  the Chinese rugs, also, is generally less harmony of colour, as
  well as less co-ordination of design, than in the Persian. The
  scroll and floral patterns appear on the field in isolated
  figures, or else imitate with more formal drawing the diaper
  pattern of some Iranian carpets. Only in the rugs of India is
  there a similarity to the patterns and colour tones of those of
  Persia; but the designs are more realistically drawn, less
  artistically arranged, and less profuse.</p>

  <h4><i>COLOUR PLATE IV&mdash;BERGAMO RUG</i></h4>

  <p><i>The weaver of this interesting Bergamo followed the early
  Asia Minor traditions in the use of rich, deep blue and red of
  field and border, yet in respect to pattern showed his freedom
  from conventionality by departing from types peculiar to his
  district and adopting many nomadic designs prevalent throughout
  Anatolia. Reciprocal latch-hooks form the background of the
  central field, on which are three upright panels containing
  octagonal discs; and latch-hooks surrounding lozenges and forming
  what may originally have been intended to represent the tree of
  life appear almost as conspicuously in the border. There are also
  combs, knots of destiny, and innumerable S-forms. The panels at
  the upper and lower ends of the field and the reciprocal vandykes
  are most suggestive of Ladiks, but in the place of pomegranates
  at the ends of the upright stalks are small checquered squares.
  Bergamos with such patterns are now rarely seen.</i></p>

    width="550" height="698" alt="COLOUR PLATE IV--BERGAMO RUG" title="" />
  </div>

  <p>The similarity in the rugs of the Persian group is due to past
  political influences as well as to common ties of race and
  religion. From the time when Ctesiphon and Babylon vied with the
  cities of Persia in the splendour of their capitals, all of this
  territory was repeatedly under one and the same dominant power,
  which at different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id=
  "Page_103">103</a></span> times was held by Saracens, Seljukian
  Turks, Timurids, and Safavids; and even after the end of the
  Safavid dynasty the influence of Nadir Shah was felt over
  Mesopotamia as well as Western Afghanistan. A still stronger
  influence is that of race; for Aryans, Arabs, Armenians, and
  Turks have blended with the early people of the whole territory,
  until not only do all resemble one another, but their
  craftsmanship is similar. Furthermore, with the exception of a
  few rapidly disappearing Parsees, who still cling to the early
  Zoroastrian faith, all are Mohammedans; and in their frequent
  pilgrimages to the same shrines is a constant interchange of
  ideas and exchange of fabrics. It is true Asia Minor, Caucasia,
  and India have shared to some extent the same influences, but to
  a much less degree.</p>

  <p>A resemblance, also, exists between many of the physical
  features of the entire country that affect the habits and
  industries of the people. To be sure the Euphrates and Tigris,
  that wind sluggishly through the great Mesopotamian valley, and
  the great ranges of the Elburz and Zagros, that extend from Mt.
  Ararat easterly and southeasterly through Persia, have no
  counterpart; but on the other hand in Mesopotamia, Persia, and
  Western Afghanistan are great stretches of sandy wastes where
  there is little vegetation, high table-lands where during
  rainless summer months the earth is parched, and little valleys
  of fertile soil that are watered by streams from the encircling
  mountain ridges. Throughout this territory, wherever physical
  conditions are similar, the people follow similar pursuits. In
  the deserts the impoverished Bedouins live; in the higher lands
  some two millions of nomads follow their sheep and goats,
  pitching their tents wherever there is pasture; in the valleys
  are several millions of people, who, with the placid contentment
  of the East, irrigate their garden patches, fashion simple
  articles of metal, and weave artistic rugs.</p>

  <p>A general decadence in social, political, and industrial life
  pervades the whole country; yet due partly to the inheritance of
  a past associated with the glories of Persepolis and Ecbatana,
  Babylon and Nineveh, Bagdad and Ctesiphon, and to the more
  immediate influence of the textile masterpieces of three
  centuries ago, rugs are still produced that in delicacy of weave,
  beauty of design, and harmony of colours surpass those of any
  other part of the world. In the weave of the best examples is
  displayed a technical skill only approached by a few of the Royal
  Bokharas. In the fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id=
  "Page_104">104</a></span> rhythm of lines and in the colour
  scheme of harmonious and delicate tones, with which a few of the
  best products of India alone compare, is united the touch of both
  artist and artisan. The fields of the old pieces are lavishly
  covered with intricate designs of buds and blossoms supported by
  vines or tendrils, and frequently encircled by arabesques that
  interlace so as to form an harmonious whole. The fields of the
  modern pieces are frequently of solid colour, with central
  medallions and triangular corners defined by graceful lines.
  Again, the ground colour of the field, which is either uniform or
  slightly shading from one end to the other, is covered with
  realistically drawn or conventionalised floral designs that are
  arranged with studied precision, and are now and then relieved by
  some nomadic design. Surrounding the fields are borders of
  several stripes, some of which contain an undulating vine with
  pendent flowers or palmettes co-ordinate in drawing and colouring
  with the main pattern. It is, however, principally in the
  colours, which are delicate yet rich, subdued yet lustrous, that
  these rugs surpass all others. Their most distinctive tones are
  blues, reds, browns, and greens, so arranged that the ground
  colours of border and field generally contrast yet remain in
  perfect harmony; as where there is some moss green in border and
  wine colour in field, each being subordinated to other
  superimposed colours representing floral detail.</p>

    <p class="center">MAP OF PERSIA</p>
  </div>

  <p>The best known of the floral patterns, repeated with formal
  precision throughout the field, is the Herati pattern, which is
  of uncertain antiquity and origin. It consists of a central
  figure that generally represents a rose, but sometimes a peony or
  rosette, about which are grouped other figures like crumpled or
  lance-shaped leaves. Probably both the central and encircling
  figures are of Persian origin, though the latter have been
  regarded by some authorities as representing fish and attributed
  to Egypt or to China; in fact, they are occasionally drawn so as
  distinctly to show eyes and fins. Very frequently four of these
  figures are arranged about a lattice-shaped design with pendants
  and a central rosette, as in Plate <a href="#po">O</a>, Fig. 4
  (Page 291). This Herati or Fish Pattern, as it is frequently
  called, appears in many of the old Persian rugs and in most of
  the modern pieces, particularly the Feraghans and Herats. A less
  frequently seen floral pattern, which has been used from a very
  remote time and is still represented in modern rugs, is the Guli
  Hinnai, or Flower of Hinnai (Plate <a href="#po">O</a>, Fig. 3).
  Of this plant Mohammed was so fond that he called it the
  &ldquo;chief of this world and the next.&rdquo; <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span> It
  occurs as a formal pattern in many of the Feraghans, and in
  several other rugs in which its bright five-petalled flowers are
  scattered informally over the field. Another floral pattern
  frequently seen is the Mina Khani, illustrated in Plate <a href=
  "#po">O</a>, Fig. 2, that was named after Mina Khan, a former
  Persian ruler. It is particularly characteristic of Persian
  Kurdish pieces in which a dark blue field is covered by a network
  of intersecting olive-coloured vines. At the intersections are
  placed large flowers that alternate in regular series according
  to their different designs and colours; and between them often
  appear other flowers, such as the smaller and brighter coloured
  Hinnai, so as to destroy too great stiffness of design. As the
  flowers are relatively large and sufficiently separate to show
  the intervening blue field, this is one of the most effective of
  the formal repetitive floral patterns. A still more formal
  pattern (Plate O, Fig. 1), which appeared in some of the Persian
  rugs of the XVI and XVII centuries, was named after Shah Abbas.
  It is not unlikely that it was suggested by the Mina Khani
  design, to which it bears a slight resemblance; but the principal
  motive is so conventionalised that it has lost much of the floral
  character. Between the large and formal palmettes, that are
  arranged with mathematical precision, are grouped with similar
  regularity smaller palmettes, connected by angular vines and
  leafy branches.</p>

  <p>Only a few Persian rugs have the formal repetitive patterns,
  such as the Herati, Guli Hinnai, Mina Khani, and Shah Abbas.
  Others have the repetitive pattern of bushes, flowers, or the
  pear, on a field of rich colour. The remainder have patterns
  consisting largely of scrolls, vines, or tendrils, drawn with
  exquisite art and decorated with leaves, flowers, and buds in
  beautiful profusion; also birds, beasts, human beings, demons,
  and other imaginary shapes, sometimes associated with the foliage
  but frequently bearing no apparent relation to it, appear as
  special motives. Since many of these forms, which originated in
  the remote past, have been transplanted from one country to
  another, and conventionalised to meet the new environment, it is
  interesting to observe the designs in the different classes of
  rugs and trace as far as possible the influences to which they
  are due.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Herats.</span>&mdash;On great
  lines of travel between India, Turkestan, and Persia, the city of
  Herat in Northwestern Afghanistan for centuries occupied
  commercially a most important position, so<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span> that
  its people long since became familiar with the best fabrics of
  the surrounding countries. During the XV Century it reached its
  greatest prosperity, and exerted an important influence on the
  art and culture of Western Asia. Before the art decadence that
  followed the capture of the city by Nadir Shah in 1731, and the
  removal of many of its artisans to Persia, its looms were
  producing some of the best rugs of the Orient, which excelled in
  delicacy of drawing and in perfect harmony of colours. The fields
  contained patterns of serrated leaves entwined with flowing
  arabesques, scrolls, and Chinese cloud-bands. Conspicuous among
  this tracery were palmettes and such flowers as the lotus and
  peony, which were often most realistically drawn.<a name=
  "FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class=
  "fnanchor">17</a> These rugs are of further interest, as they
  contained in field and border the design that, slightly changed,
  appears in many of the later rugs of Persia as the Herati
  pattern.</p>

  <p>The modern rugs are as unlike other Afghans as were the
  antique pieces and show a close relationship to those of Persia.
  Nor is this surprising, as the weavers, though falling far short
  of the high standards of the time when Herat was part of Persia,
  are still mindful of the early traditions. Moreover, many of the
  rugs are made across the border in Khorassan, and have the silky
  pile peculiar to the rugs of that province; but their tones of
  colour, consisting principally of red or blue in the field, and
  light green, yellow, and ivory in the border, as well as most of
  the patterns, are dissimilar. In one type the fields are covered
  with pear designs; but their bent narrow ends always turn in the
  same direction, whilst those of other rugs turn in different
  directions in alternate rows. Another type suggests the
  Feraghans, because their fields are covered with the Herati or
  Fish pattern; but the borders of the Feraghans usually have the
  well-known turtle pattern, while the borders of these adhere to
  the traditional Herati design. It is also not unusual to see a
  large central medallion, in which blue or red predominates,
  separated by a field of lighter colour from the triangular
  patterns of the corners. Now and then, a nomadic influence is
  seen in the small adventitious figures of the field.</p>

  </div>

  <p>One of the most characteristic features of this class are the
  borders, that generally have three stripes, of which the central
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id=
  "Page_107">107</a></span>consists of a continuous vine of
  crumpled leaves so conventionalised as to be merely bent, thorny
  stalks partly enveloping formal rosettes. The other stripes are
  narrow, and have some simple undulating vine. This typical
  border, the stout, closely woven warp and weft of cotton, their
  large, almost square shapes and rather coarse weave, are
  important aids in distinguishing this class from all others. Some
  of the rugs recently made are coarse; but the older rugs have
  excellent dyes, lustrous nap, and matured tones of well-blended
  colours.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i><a name="FNanchor_18" id=

  <i>Colours</i>, principally red and blue with minor quantities of
  green, yellow, and ivory. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes, rarely Sehna.
  Knots to inch horizontally, eight to eleven; perpendicularly,
  nine to twelve. A half knot, as it appears at back, is about as
  long, measured in direction of length of rug, as wide.<a name=
  "FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class=
  "fnanchor">19</a> The rows of knots are firmly pressed down so
  that the warp is concealed at back. <i>Warp</i>, of cotton,
  rarely wool; one of the two threads encircled by a knot is
  generally doubled under the other, sometimes it is only
  depressed. <i>Weft</i>, wool, occasionally cotton; of coarse
  diameter. For a short space a thread of weft crosses twice, that
  is across and back once, between every two rows of knots, then
  three times, and so alternates every several rows. <i>Pile</i>,
  wool of medium length, soft, and silky. <i>Border</i>, three to
  five stripes, and frequently an outer edging of uniform colour.
  <i>Sides</i>, a double overcasting. <i>Both ends</i>, narrow web
  and loose warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, stout and firm.

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Khorassans.</span>&mdash;Among
  Iranians, Khorassan is often spoken of as the Land of the Sun. In
  its northern part are long ranges of mountains where herds and
  flocks find excellent pastures, and intervening valleys where the
  soil is cultivated. But the remainder of the province, with the
  exception of scattered oases, where small towns and villages are
  located, is almost entirely a desert, from which in classic times
  the Parthians advanced to harass the armies of Greece and Rome,
  then retreated to seek the protection of its vast salt marshes
  and inhospitable wastes.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id=
  "Page_108">108</a></span></p>

  <p>Nevertheless, in the little villages surrounded by a dreary
  wilderness have been produced as beautiful rugs as in those more
  favoured spots where prevailed cultured influences that could
  develop an Omar Khayyam and produce the sacred shrine of Meshed.
  Even before the Mongolian invasion several hundred looms, each
  employing four or five women, were busy in the town of Toon in
  Central Khorassan. Lying farther to the east is the district of
  Kain, which was once renowned for its beautiful rugs of Herati
  pattern, but of later years has produced coarser pieces with
  inferior designs and bad colours. Still better known was Birjand,
  in the southeastern part of the province, where formerly were
  woven pieces of superior workmanship that contained from two
  hundred to three hundred knots to the square inch. Their colours
  were of delicate shades; and it was not unusual to employ ivory
  or other light tones for the ground, with which was contrasted
  the darker tones of the Herati or pear patterns. Over a century
  ago many such towns in Khorassan were weaving rugs of artistic
  design and beautiful colours, but as a rule the present products
  fall far below the early standards.</p>

  <p>Most of the Khorassans now seen were made almost fifty years
  or more ago and rival the best of modern Persian rugs. As a rule,
  they are of large size and have closely woven texture. They can
  be distinguished from most others by the silkiness of their
  moderately long nap, which is often due to the fact that it is
  from the fleece of a yearling lamb as well as because it is cut
  long and unevenly. Another characteristic is the use of some
  shade of red, as a pink, rose, or wine colour. Very frequently it
  is magenta or even purple, which are rarely found in other
  Persian rugs. Blue and cream are also largely employed. Their
  colours are generally softened by age, yet are warm, and at times
  brilliant, as when a large field of bright rose red or blue
  surrounds a central medallion.</p>

  <p>The diversity of pattern in Khorassans is partly due to
  copying designs of rugs brought from other provinces by the
  pilgrims who yearly visit Meshed, and to the remoteness from one
  another of different centres of weaving in a province occupying
  one fourth of all Persia. One pattern, however, based upon the
  treatment of the pear design, which is employed in many of these
  pieces, at once distinguishes them from rugs of other districts.
  It consists of large pears arranged in regular order on a field
  of dark colour with their principal axes inclined diagonally in
  the same direction, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109"
  id="Page_109">109</a></span> of two or three much smaller pears
  partly resting on them and partly projecting beyond their edges.
  Unlike the pear designs in other Persian rugs, which are oval,
  these are elongated like those of Indian rugs; and within them,
  as well as in the field, are often small floral figures. This
  distinctive pattern is rendered more effective by the colour
  scheme; since frequently pears of red or magenta, defined by
  lines of yellow and containing white petalled flowers, rest upon
  a ground of dark blue. The Herati design is also frequently
  employed, and in very old pieces are occasionally represented
  birds and animals naturalistically drawn. It is not unusual to
  see a central medallion or large vase of flowers surrounded by a
  field of bright uniform colour, and in some rugs are two
  medallions. When the centre contains a medallion, the
  triangular-shaped corners are set off by lines that are much
  simpler than those in Sarouks and Kermanshahs.</p>

  <p>Few other rugs have more noticeable borders; for not only are
  they very wide, but in the main stripe, which is as wide as
  several guard stripes, is some characteristic pattern.
  Occasionally it contains the Herati design, but more frequently
  it consists of a heavy undulating vine with incipient flower
  forms, that at times almost assume the appearance of a
  bird&rsquo;s head resting on a sub-pattern of double floral vine.
  This stripe, illustrated in Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 2,
  (opp. Page 156) is so frequently met with in Khorassans as to be
  characteristic of them. The narrow guard stripes usually contain
  some simple vine or ornate reciprocal figure.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally rose,
  blue, and ivory, with minor quantities of yellow and green.
  <i>Knot</i>, Sehna. Many are &ldquo;left-hand.&rdquo; Knots to
  inch horizontally, eight to thirteen; perpendicularly, twelve to
  twenty. The rows of knots are firmly pressed down, so that the
  warp is concealed and the weft is partly hidden at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, cotton; one of the two threads encircled by a knot
  is doubled under the other. A few short lengths of threads of
  warp hang loose at the back of some pieces. <i>Weft</i>, almost
  always cotton, occasionally wool of fine diameter and usually
  dyed blue. A thread of weft crosses twice between two rows of
  knots, excepting at intervals of every six or eight rows of
  knots, where it crosses three or more times. <i>Pile</i>, wool of
  medium length, silky and unevenly clipped. <i>Border</i>, three
  to six stripes, and generally an outer edging of uniform colour.
  <i>Sides</i>, a double overcasting of same colour as edging.
  <i>Both ends</i>, a narrow web and short warp fringe.
  <i>Texture</i>, moderately firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of
  moderately fine grain. <i>Usual<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span> length</i>, five to
  twelve feet. <i>Usual width</i>, three fifths to three quarters
  length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Mesheds.</span>&mdash;In few
  parts of the East have the weavers received greater inspiration
  from sacred and historic association than those of Meshed. To
  Shiite Mohammedans it contains the most holy spot in Persia; for
  within a mosque resplendent with fa&ccedil;ade of blue and white
  tiles, and with gilded minarets of exquisite design, lie the
  remains of Ali Riza, the eighth Imam or Moslem priest, in a tomb
  that is viewed yearly by nearly one hundred thousand pilgrims. It
  was for a short time the capital of Shah Abbas, who beautified
  its mosques; and here Nadir Shah, whose remains lie in the
  mausoleum, held his court after the capture of Delhi. Within its
  walls was born Firdousi, the Homer of Persia; and not far away,
  among the mountains to the west, was the home of the poet and
  astronomer, Omar Khayyam. Not only devotees but large numbers of
  merchants regularly visit the city in the caravans from Khiva,
  Bokhara, Herat, Yezd, and Teheran, so that it is also a city of
  commercial importance.</p>

  <p>It is possible that a few of those matchless pieces which were
  attributed to Herat before its destruction by Nadir Shah were
  made in the district near Meshed, since according to an Arabian
  traveller<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> who visited it during the
  XIV Century many fine carpets then lay on the floor of its
  mosque. It is also believed that within the shrine, which has
  never been entered by an unbeliever, still remain some of the
  most magnificent carpets of the Orient. But for more than a
  century the textile industry has been declining, and the rugs now
  seen are generally of recent manufacture.</p>

  <p>As a rule, these rugs are of the Khorassan type, and have the
  same silky appearance of nap, though it is shorter and more
  evenly clipped. The pattern, however, is generally different, as
  seldom is the field completely covered with the pear design, but
  whenever used, it is of elaborate drawing and frequently very
  large. Nor is the characteristic Khorassan border stripe,
  illustrated in Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 2 (opp. Page 156),
  employed. On the other hand, it is not usual to see large central
  medallions, with floral designs in tones of rose or pink on
  fields of blue or ivory, and borders with undulating floral
  vines, in which appears evidence of Herati influence. Most of the
  rugs that now exist were made within the last fifty years, and
  are of large <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id=
  "Page_111">111</a></span>size and almost square shape. The colour
  scheme inclines to light and often brilliant tones, which at
  times are strongly contrasted with small masses of much darker
  shades. The wool is excellent, and the warp and weft are rarely
  coarse.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Ispahans.</span>&mdash;Still
  imposing in the ruins of its former splendour, surrounded by
  orchards, vineyards, and groves of trees that shade a broad,
  well-watered plain, is the ancient city of Ispahan. Under the
  Caliphs it became the capital of Persia; and though sacked by
  Tamerlane, who slew seventy thousand of its inhabitants, it rose
  to such importance that in the XVII Century it contained within
  its walls several palaces, one hundred and sixty mosques, over
  two score of colleges, nearly two thousand caravansaries, and
  about three quarters of a million people. Now the population has
  dwindled to about sixty thousand; and the few stately mosques and
  colleges that remain amid miles of deserted streets, abandoned
  bazaars, and ruined homes but feebly reflect the magnificence of
  the former capital.</p>

  <p>Here was the royal court of Shah Abbas, who sent to Italy, for
  the purpose of studying decorative art, a number of the most
  experienced artisans, to whom are accredited some of the
  gracefully drawn designs of many of the early carpets. Here, in
  the days of its greatest prosperity, were founded many
  industries, and on its looms were undoubtedly woven some of the
  best of old Persian carpets.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span> Though Herat is now
  regarded by some authorities as the centre where the so-called
  Ispahan rugs were made, it is improbable, as previously pointed
  out, that all of them came from there. But after the death of
  Shah Abbas the rug industry began to decline; and with the
  removal of the capital to Shiraz, in 1760, Ispahan ceased to be a
  rug-producing centre of consequence. There may be a doubt whether
  such enormous carpets, as the one with length of sixty feet and
  breadth of thirty that Sir Purdon Clark in his monograph on
  Oriental Carpets mentions as lying in the hall of Chehel Sutoon
  at Ispahan, were made there or were imported from other cities;
  but the weaving of rugs has never entirely ceased; and so great
  is the fame of the former glory of the city that even now
  Oriental dealers will often apply to rugs the term
  &ldquo;Ispahan&rdquo; as an epithet of superiority.</p>

  <p>The few modern pieces which reach the western markets bear
  little resemblance to their prototypes; and even among themselves
  show little similarity of pattern, though the pear and Herati
  designs are not uncommon. In some rugs a century old the field is
  almost covered with what is known as the Persian crown jewel, and
  in others the field contains diamond-shaped medallions arranged
  in regular order with small foliate and floral forms placed
  between them. Small figures of animals are also occasionally
  represented. The border is generally narrow and lacking in
  impressive individuality, so that the character of the rugs
  depends largely on the pattern of the field and the well-seasoned
  colours, which are always rich and harmonious. Some shade of red
  or blue is usually chosen for the ground; and in the designs are
  green, yellow, and white. The weave has variations rarely found
  in other rugs; for the warp, which is usually cotton, may also be
  wool, or wool and cotton twisted together; and the weft may
  likewise be wool or cotton, and may cross between the rows of
  knots either once or twice in different rugs, or even once or
  twice in the same rug.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i><a name="FNanchor_21" id=

  <i>Colours</i>, principally red and blue, with minor quantities

  horizontally six to nine; perpendicularly, eight to fourteen. The
  rows of knots are firmly pressed down. <i>Warp</i>, usually
  cotton, occasionally wool; in a few pieces wool or cotton are
  twisted together. Each thread of warp is equally prominent at
  back. <i>Weft</i>, wool or cotton. A thread of weft crosses once
  or twice between two rows of <span class='pagenum'><a name=

  generally crosses twice; if of cotton, two threads are generally
  placed side by side and cross together once as a single thread.
  <i>Pile</i>, wool, of short or medium length. <i>Sides</i>, a
  double selvage of two or three chords. <i>Lower end</i>, a web.
  <i>Upper end</i>, a web and fringe. Occasionally the web is
  turned back and hemmed. <i>Texture</i>, firm. <i>Weave</i> at

  feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two fifths to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Kirmans.</span>&mdash;On
  account of the isolated position of Kirman in Southeastern
  Persia, where the almost impassable saline and sandy deserts by
  which it is surrounded on the north and east, and the mountain
  ridges that separate it from the fertile valleys of Persia on the
  west, in a measure protected it from the repeated invasions that
  disturbed the political and industrial conditions of Northern
  Persia, it has continuously for over a thousand years been an
  important centre for the manufacture of rugs. Moreover, during
  all this period it has been noted for the excellence of their
  quality. As early as the Mohammedan conquests its fabrics were
  taken to furnish the floors and divans of Caliphs&rsquo; palaces.
  When Marco Polo visited Persia in 1270 he wrote of the beautiful
  shawls and carpets made by the women of Kirman; and the noted
  French traveller Chardin, who lived in that country during part
  of the XVII Century, also spoke most favourably of them. Even
  after Nadir Shah removed many of the most skilled weavers to the
  northern part of Persia subsequent to ascending the throne in
  1739, and Aga Mohammed Khan pillaged the city and massacred many
  of the inhabitants in 1794, the rug industry continued to
  prosper, and to-day that district is producing the best of modern
  pieces.</p>

  <p>To this isolation is also largely due the excellence of the
  weave and dyes, since the artisans have in a measure escaped the
  pernicious influences of market demands and aniline colours. And
  to it must be attributed the fact that the old Iranian textile
  art appears nowhere else in greater purity; for of all the rugs
  on the market to-day these conform more nearly in texture,
  colour, and design to the masterpieces of earlier times, and show
  none of the foreign influences appearing in pieces woven in the
  north. And yet in Kirman is complexity of race as well as
  religion; for the Beluches who have wandered across the desert
  mingle with the Persians; and the Guebres, still practising in
  secret their fire worship, meet with the Mohammedans.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id=
  "Page_114">114</a></span>For long ages silkworms have been
  cultivated in the district about Kirman and fed on the mulberry
  trees that grow wild among its hills, so that it is not
  surprising that small quantities of silk are sometimes used in
  the rugs; but as a rule the pile is entirely of wool, yet of such
  fine quality and so well woven that many of the old pieces have a
  lustrous and silky appearance. This wool, which is white and of
  unusually fine texture, is partly the product of the native sheep
  and partly the product of a variety of goats that live among the
  ridges and yield fleeces almost as fine as those of Kashmir.</p>

  <p>It is probably because of the fondness of the people of Kirman
  for roses, which they cultivate for the attar, that they depict
  them so profusely in their rugs. Sometimes they represent them as
  filling vases set in rows, or again as formal bouquets arranged
  in regular order upon the field. They also weave them in the
  borders among green leaves, as placed there tenderly and not
  hanging from such stiffly formed vines as are seen in other
  Persian rugs. Nor are they conventionalised like the flowers of
  most modern rugs; but petal, leaf, and stem are drawn with a
  precision that suggests the work of Indian weavers. Usually they
  are red contrasting with a ground colour of soft, ashy grey in
  the field, and of golden yellow in the rich, harmonious border.
  Sometimes, instead of a profusion of roses, there are other
  flowers, such as the sunflower, suggesting the old Zoroastrian
  faith, the cypress, or the sacred &ldquo;cocos.&rdquo; Again, the
  general design may be modified from one strictly floral, and amid
  the foliage may be introduced birds, animals, or human beings;
  but the naturalistic drawing is always noticeable. In modern
  pieces the central medallion is often adopted, yet the general
  resemblance to older pieces is evident. As a rule the border has
  five stripes, of which the main one is twice the width of any
  other, and surrounding the outer is a narrow edging that is
  usually pinkish red; though now and then, according to the
  general colour scheme, a very pleasing effect is obtained by
  substituting an edging of moss green.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Yezd.</span>&mdash;In the
  centre of a sandy plain, midway between Kirman and Kashan, is the
  city of Yezd, where almost the last of the Iranian
  fire-worshippers, now a small part of the total population, still
  follow the ancient faith. Though partly shut off from the great
  desert of Khorassan by a mountain range, the city is only an
  oasis, where the drifting sands that buried the old city ever
  suggest to the inhabitants the dread spirit of desolation which
  finds an echo in ruined walls within. At the present time very
  few piled rugs are woven there and they are rarely seen in
  Western markets; yet on account of the historic interest in its
  people, the name is sometimes applied to modern products made in
  other districts. At one time it was noted for its silk rugs, and
  also for its felt &ldquo;namads,&rdquo; which are generally too
  heavy to be transported, since some of them have a thickness of
  two inches and a superficial area of ten thousand square
  feet.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Shiraz.</span>&mdash;Near the
  centre of a small, well-cultivated valley encircled by mountains
  is Shiraz, capital of Farsistan. During the reign of Kerim Khan,
  from 1760 to 1779, it was the capital of Persia; but since then
  it has suffered from earthquakes and neglect until now much of
  its former glory has departed. And yet there still remain
  associations to kindle the imagination, for without the gates are
  the gardens that Persian poets have extolled in verse; the tombs
  of Saadi and Hafiz; and not far away are the spots where Cyrus,
  Darius, and Xerxes lived, and the ruined palaces that Alexander
  destroyed in a night of drunken revelry.</p>

  <p>As early as the time of the Caliphs this district produced
  large numbers of carpets; though few, if any, remain that were
  woven before the XV Century. As is the case with modern pieces,
  all of them were distinguished for their soft and beautiful wool,
  which is to be attributed to the climate and pasture of the
  surrounding mountains and valleys. One of the oldest
  existing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id=
  "Page_116">116</a></span> rugs of this district which displays
  the characteristic wool is referred to by Dr. F. R. Martin in the
  following words:<a name="FNanchor_22" id=
  "FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
  &ldquo;As soon as I had touched it, I was certain that we had to
  deal with a very rare kind of carpets which were made at Shiraz,
  or at least with the brilliant Shiraz wool. Most of the carpets
  made of that wool are lost, because the material was such a soft
  one that it was easily worn out. I know of very few which are
  older than the eighteenth century. No wool in all Persia takes
  such rich and deep colour as the Shiraz wool. The deep blue and
  the dark ruby red are equally extraordinary, and that is due to
  the brilliancy of the wool, which is firmer and, so to say, more
  transparent than silk, and makes one think of translucent enamel.
  As a piece of colour this carpet is certainly one of the finest,
  and there are very few carpets that have greater charm, which
  even the best reproduction could not give. In its colours there
  is something of an early Gothic stained-glass window, where the
  dust of ages has so covered the design that it has become
  obscured and the imagination of the spectator must complete it.
  Certainly the Persians for whom this carpet was made used to sit
  and dream for hours over the beauty of its colours, beautiful as
  the wonderful landscape surrounding Shiraz.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On account of the design and workmanship of this remarkable
  piece it is referred by Dr. Martin to the XV Century. During the
  two following centuries the carpets of Shiraz attained the high
  standard of excellence prevalent in the principal cities of
  Persia; but most of those pieces are now extremely rare, as they
  were woven chiefly for imperial use or for exchange with foreign
  rulers. This city experienced the art decadence that began with
  the XVIII Century, yet under the patronage of Kerim Khan imperial
  factories for weaving were again established there.</p>

  <p>Though some of the rugs made eighty or even sixty years ago
  are certainly beautiful, these modern pieces, as a rule, lack the
  excellent qualities of early rugs, and those more recently woven
  are still poorer. On a few of them are depicted designs that are
  strictly Persian; but they generally depart widely from the early
  traditions, and floral forms are very much conventionalised. In a
  large number of this class the field is covered with pear designs
  which are described by straight lines and angles. Sometimes they
  are as small as in the Sarabends, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span> occupying the whole field
  as the principal motive; or they may be placed less prominently
  within diagonal or perpendicular stripes. Again, they may be as
  large as in Khorassans and grouped with other designs. Another
  very common pattern, known as the &ldquo;pole-medallion,&rdquo;
  consists of a narrow perpendicular bar connecting two or more
  large diamond-shaped figures on which are grouped
  conventionalised floral forms and geometric designs. In other
  pieces the pattern is as geometric as that of any Caucasian rug,
  and it is not unusual to see both field and border profusely
  adorned with latch-hooks enclosed within and surrounding
  geometric figures. Nor is it unusual to see small figures of men
  and animals scattered through the field. Indeed, there is no
  other Persian rug in which the pattern is so heterogeneous. The
  borders usually consist of a number of narrow stripes, or a wide
  one with narrow guard stripes. One of them, at least, almost
  invariably contains some form of vine and leaves, and not
  infrequently the row of small X figures that also appear in
  Shirvans. In fact, the rugs are sometimes mistaken for Shirvans
  on account of the resemblance in geometric designs.</p>

  <p>Though there is such variety in the patterns, these rugs are
  not difficult to recognise. There is something distinctive about
  the dark blues and reds contrasted with smaller areas of ivory
  and yellow. They are, as a rule, loosely woven, and many of them
  have a trait of lying unevenly on the floor. Not infrequently an
  extra band of pile is woven between the border and the broad
  embroidered webs of the ends, from which hang a loose fringe. The
  sides are overcast with heavy strands of wool varied like a
  barber-pole at regular intervals; and, as is not the case with
  any other class, they are often ornamented at intervals with
  coloured tassels.</p>

  <p>There are also large numbers of Shiraz saddle-bags, which are
  superior to any others made. They resemble the Caucasian, as the
  patterns are geometric; but they may be distinguished from them
  by the finer wool and a slightly different colour scheme.</p>

  <p>Not infrequently the term &ldquo;Mecca&rdquo; is applied to
  Shiraz rugs, and the impression is conveyed that they were made
  there. Nor is the statement always entirely devoid of truth; for
  each year caravans aggregating some two hundred thousand souls
  enter that city to make their devotions to Allah, to walk around
  the sacred stone within the Kaaba, and leaving behind their
  forgotten sins to return homeward with a bit of sacred earth or a
  strip of the temple&rsquo;s covering. Each of these pilgrims
  bears offerings for propi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118"
  id="Page_118">118</a></span>tiation, of which a large proportion
  are rugs; and whatever their size, they are invariably the
  choicest the devotee can offer. Since the Mohammedan priests
  regard the best interests of their religion and themselves as
  conserved by a disposition of all articles not directly available
  for their use, they sell large quantities of such rugs, that find
  their way to Cairo, Damascus, and Constantinople. Furthermore,
  the pilgrims carry many pieces which are sold or exchanged along
  the routes of the caravans or at Mecca, and ultimately reach the
  same markets. Such a large number of the pieces that years ago
  came from these sources were of the well-known type of Shiraz
  rugs that they and similar pieces which had never left Persia
  were called Mecca rugs. This deception is still encouraged by
  some dealers, because for many buyers a special interest is
  attached to a piece that they are persuaded has been carried on
  this pilgrimage as an offering.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Type Characteristics.</span>
  <i>Colours</i>, principally blue, red, and ivory, with minor
  quantities of yellow and green. <i>Knot</i>, generally Sehna,
  frequently Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally seven to twelve;
  perpendicularly, eight to twelve. At back one of the half knots
  is generally smaller than the other and pressed to one side. The
  other half knot is about as long as wide, and the yarn is not
  drawn tight against the warp. The rows of knots are pressed down,
  so that their alignment is slightly irregular, and the warp is
  concealed at back. <i>Warp</i>, almost always wool; in a few
  modern rugs goats&rsquo; hair is used. Each of the threads
  encircled by a knot is almost equally prominent at back, or
  occasionally one to each knot is depressed. <i>Weft</i>, wool of
  medium diameter, frequently coloured red. A thread of weft
  crosses twice between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool,
  short to medium, and silky. <i>Border</i>, three to five stripes.
  Beyond the borders, at each end, is frequently a narrow band of
  pile. <i>Sides</i>, a heavy double overcasting in a barber-pole
  stripe or in short lengths of different colours, which generally
  consist of two of the following colours: red, yellow, green, and
  blue. In some pieces small tufts of wool protrude from the sides
  at regular intervals of one or more feet. <i>Lower end</i>, a
  broad web of coloured stripes, through which may run a dovetailed
  coloured cord, and warp loops. <i>Upper end</i>, a broad web of
  coloured stripes, through which may run a dovetailed coloured
  cord, and warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, loose. <i>Weave</i> at
  back is of slightly coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, five to
  nine feet. <i>Usual width</i>, three fifths to four fifths

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Niris.</span>&mdash;A
  resemblance exists between the rugs that take their name from
  Lake Niris and those of Shiraz, which is distant only fifty miles
  to the westward; for many of each class are woven with the same
  silky wool, obtained from sheep that graze in the intervening
  mountain ranges, and the shepherd weavers about the lake have
  acquired ideas from the old capital. This resemblance exists
  mostly in the soft, floccy appearance of the nap, and in the
  barber-pole or parti-coloured overcasting of the sides. The webs
  of each end are broad and have long fringes; but generally those
  of the Shiraz are embroidered and crossed with one or more
  parti-coloured cords, whilst those of Niris pieces are, as a
  rule, flatly woven in stripes of different colours. There is also
  an occasional resemblance in pattern, but the best known pattern
  of the Niris is rarely seen in the Shiraz. On the other hand,
  they are more firmly woven; and there is a slight difference in
  the character of their weave, since one of the two threads of
  warp encircled by a knot is depressed below the other, and the
  weft is of wool coloured red, whereas in the Shiraz it is
  frequently of cotton.</p>

  <p>The pears are the favourite design, and, like those in
  Sarabends, extend over the field in orderly array; but they are
  much larger and consist of an assemblage of bright colours
  isolated from one another, yet grouped gracefully in a way that
  might readily suggest the origin of crown jewels sometimes
  ascribed to them. Frequently the ground is a dark blue, and the
  pears are of red, blue, green, and ivory. Violet and yellow are
  also employed. In other types, less usually seen, the field is
  covered with a lattice-work pattern containing small figures. The
  typical border has a broad central stripe of vine and flower,
  with narrow guards of simpler vine or reciprocal trefoil.
  Barber-pole stripes are also characteristic of the borders.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally blue,
  red, yellow, green, and ivory. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to
  inch horizontally six to eleven; perpendicularly, seven to
  fifteen. The rows of knots are not closely pressed down, so that
  at the back the warp is noticeable and the weft conspicuous.
  <i>Warp</i>, wool; one of the two threads encircled by a knot is
  depressed below the other at back and frequently doubled under
  the other. <i>Weft</i>, wool of medium diameter, generally dyed
  red. A thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows of
  knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium length. <i>Border</i>,
  generally of three stripes, sometimes as many as seven.
  <i>Sides</i>, a heavy double overcasting in a barber-pole stripe
  or in short lengths of different<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span> colours, such as red,
  blue, green, yellow, and black. <i>Both</i> ends, a broad web of
  coloured stripes, one row of knots, and loose warp fringe.
  <i>Texture</i>, loose. <i>Weave</i> at back is of slightly coarse
  grain. <i>Usual length</i>, four to seven feet. <i>Usual
  width</i>, three quarters to four fifths length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class=
  "smcap">Feraghans.</span>&mdash;Stretching eastward from the base
  of Mt. Elwund is the plain of Feraghan. Its length does not
  exceed forty-five miles, nor its breadth ten or fifteen, yet here
  are clustered several hundred villages. On account of its
  altitude of seven thousand feet, the ground is covered with snow
  in winter, and the people are then huddled in their low mud
  houses, and the flocks and herds are gathered within the village
  walls. But in the spring the men are cultivating the fields, and
  the sheep are grazing on the banks of numerous streams. It is a
  plain of fertility and industry. For generations it has been
  productive of large numbers of fine rugs, and it is still
  possible among its villages to find some of those old pieces that
  have been regarded by the Persians themselves as the best
  examples of the textile art.</p>

  <p>When the characteristic patterns of Feraghans have once been
  carefully observed, they are never forgotten; yet it is
  surprising to note the many distinctions observable in a large
  collection. These patterns may conveniently be divided into two
  groups, namely: one in which the field is entirely covered with
  diaper designs, and the other in which the field contains a
  central medallion surrounded by uniform colour. Probably nine
  tenths of these rugs fall within the first group, which is
  divisible into three sub-groups: those in which the field is
  covered with the Herati design; those in which the field is
  covered with the Guli Hinnai design; and those in which the field
  is covered with some other small diaper design.</p>

  <p>The Herati design is the one most frequently seen, and is
  found in the very oldest of existing Feraghans. As a rule, the
  crumpled leaf does not exceed a length of four or five inches,
  and the rosettes are proportionally small, so that the ground
  colour is almost entirely concealed, and at a short distance is
  not distinguishable; but there are other pieces in which the leaf
  is over a foot in length, and the figures less closely clustered,
  so that the ground enters prominently into the colour scheme. The
  prevailing colour of the leaf and rosette is generally rose red,
  which gives a distinctly reddish tone to the rug; though the
  small designs have shades of green, yellow,<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span> white,
  and light blue. The ground is usually a rich, dark blue; but
  occasionally red or even ivory is used. In very few other rugs
  are the corners separated from the field, unless there is a
  central medallion; but in almost all Feraghans small
  triangular-shaped corners, with colours contrasting with those of
  the field, are separated from it by lines bearing teeth or
  serrated edges.</p>

  <p>Surrounding the field is a border that has from five to seven
  stripes. The main stripe is about three times as wide as any
  other, and may have a ground colour of red, blue, or ivory white;
  but in many of the best pieces it is moss green, with blue,
  yellow, or red appearing in the overlying pattern. Of different
  but corresponding shades is the colour of the ground and designs
  of other stripes. Probably three fourths of the Feraghans now
  seen have the well-known turtle design in the main stripe; but it
  is sometimes replaced by the rose design shown in Plate <a href=
  "#pe">E</a>, Fig. 12 (opp. Page 156), or by an undulating vine
  with rosette or palmettes. On the innermost stripe, which is very
  narrow, is invariably represented some reciprocal figure, as the
  trefoil or sawtooth; and on the other stripes are undulating
  vines, with floral or quasi-floral figures.</p>

  <p>The Feraghans with fields covered with Guli Hinnai designs
  instead of the Herati show a difference in both drawing and
  colouring, though the general effect is much the same. In place
  of crumpled leaves and rosettes of reddish hue are the star-like
  flowers of the Hinnai plants that brighten the mountains
  surrounding the Feraghan plain with their large yellow or ivory
  coloured petals. The pattern, as a whole, is slightly more
  prominent, and the prevailing colour tone, which is rich, is less
  red and more yellow. There is, however, a very noticeable
  difference in the pattern of the third sub-group, though
  specimens are not frequently seen. In these the small figures of
  conventionalised flowers sometimes have geometric shapes and are
  arranged in diagonal or perpendicular rows. Moreover, they
  generally lack the rich colouring of the preceding
  sub-groups.</p>

  <p>The central medallion is found not only in modern but also in
  old Feraghans. It is generally of diamond or hexagonal shape,
  with serrated edges and with pendants. Almost invariably Herati
  figures cover its surface, and not infrequently some lattice-work
  design with small conventionalised leaves or flowers appear
  faintly on the field of uniform colour surrounding it. As a rule,
  pieces of this group are of a more striking and handsome
  appearance than those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id=
  "Page_122">122</a></span> in which the entire field is covered
  with numerous minute figures of equally rich hues that blend and
  produce, when viewed at a distance, an undefined colour. The
  border designs are similar to those of the other group. All of
  the old pieces were stoutly woven; and though the nap was short,
  many of those that remain are still serviceable.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red
  and dark blue, with minor quantities of yellow, light blue,
  green, and white. <i>Knot</i>, Sehna, rarely Ghiordes. Knots to
  inch horizontally eight to thirteen; perpendicularly, seven to
  eighteen. The rows of knots are pressed down, so that the warp is
  usually concealed at back. <i>Warp</i>, cotton; each of the two
  threads encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back.
  <i>Weft</i>, cotton, occasionally dyed blue or pink. A thread of
  weft of fine or medium diameter crosses twice between every two
  rows of knots, or occasionally a thread of coarse diameter with
  much slack crosses only once, so that the transverse warp
  produces a quincunx effect. <i>Pile</i>, wool, clipped short.
  <i>Border</i>, three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a double overcasting
  in dark colour. <i>Lower end</i>, a web. <i>Upper end</i>, a web
  and warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of
  slightly coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, four to twelve feet.
  <i>Usual width</i>, three fifths to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Hamadans.</span>&mdash;A little
  to the northeast of Elwund and at an altitude that overlooks a
  small, well-cultivated valley adjacent to the Feraghan plain is
  the city of Hamadan. On this site was the ancient city of
  Ecbatana, capital of Media; and here guarded by Jews is a tomb,
  which tradition declares is the burial place of Esther and
  Mordecai. Within the encircling walls are gardens, bazaars, and
  mosques; yet the present city of forty thousand inhabitants with
  its general misery and squalor has little to remind one of the
  magnificence of that former capital which for a short period was
  mistress of the world.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 28. Bergamo Prayer
    Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>Like Yezd, Hamadan is famous for its namads; and like Yezd it
  once produced, according to tradition, most beautiful silk
  carpets, though no longer are any woven there. But its looms have
  been busy for the last few generations weaving rugs of wool and
  camels&rsquo; hair, which have such marked individuality that
  they bear unmistakably on their face the stamp of identification.
  The few old rugs that remain are sterling pieces, which are
  stoutly woven and of excellent dyes. They come in many sizes;
  some are simply mats, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123"
  id="Page_123">123</a></span>others sedjadehs, and an unusually
  large number are runners. The typical pattern of the mats and
  smaller sedjadehs consists of a central diamond-shaped medallion,
  surrounded by a field of contrasting colour, from which are set
  off the triangular-shaped corners. In the large sedjadehs and in
  the runners, which are sometimes twenty feet or more in length,
  are often three or more pole medallions, though the pole device
  may be omitted. These medallions and corners are covered with
  small, carefully drawn geometric figures, or more frequently with
  floral designs such as appear in Feraghans, and as a rule are
  defined by serrated lines or are fringed with hooks or comb-like
  teeth. The colour of the surrounding field is unobtrusive. In
  some pieces it is void of pattern, and its monotonous tone is
  broken only by slight variations of shade; yet not infrequently
  it is marked with faint lines of slightly darker or lighter tint,
  like a delicate tracery. Not only are the borders wide, but a
  broad edging, which is at least one half and sometimes two thirds
  as wide as all the coloured stripes combined, surrounds them. As
  it is usually of camels&rsquo; hair and without pattern, it is a
  very noticeable characteristic. The main stripe has an undulating
  vine with conventionalised flowers, and the two guard stripes
  have a simpler vine, or, more frequently, the reciprocal
  trefoils.</p>

  <p>To this general type, however, are many exceptions. Sometimes
  the figures of the medallion and corners are more geometric;
  sometimes the corners are omitted; the outside edging may be
  decorated with large conventionalised floral or geometric
  figures; and occasionally a camel or some other animal is
  represented in the field or border. A few of the old rugs were
  strikingly handsome. Dr. George Birdwood refers to a large
  Hamadan that formerly hung in the India Museum in these
  words:<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> &ldquo;An irregular
  lozenge form, a little island of bright clustering flowers, of
  which the prevailing colours are red and blue, adorns the centre;
  while the wide extended ground of yellow, in irregular shades,
  surrounds it with a rippling amber sea; and there are blue pieces
  in the corners, within the broad blue border worked in
  arabesques. It is a carpet not to be laid on a floor, but to be
  hung in a gallery, to be looked at like a golden sunset. It was a
  sacrilege to remove it from the mosque where it evidently was
  once spread under the great dome. <i>Beati
  possidentes.</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Most of the old pieces have disappeared, and in their places
  are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id=
  "Page_124">124</a></span>modern products with pile of wool or
  goat&rsquo;s hair often dyed in garish colours. There are also
  many nondescript rugs, which were gathered from wandering tribes
  or surrounding villages and taken to Hamadan, since for a long
  time it has been one of the great rug markets of Persia. When
  exported from there they were often classed as products of that
  city.</p>

  <p>Moderately old Hamadans contain more camel&rsquo;s hair than
  any other class of rugs, since in very many of them it forms the
  pile of both field and outer edging, where its soft tones of pale
  chestnut colour contrast with the bright shades of blue, red, and
  yellow yarn used in other parts of the field and border. This
  lavish use of camel&rsquo;s hair, the broad encircling edging,
  the cotton warp, and a single thread of coarse weft passing once
  between two rows of knots, distinguish them from all other
  rugs.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally the
  chestnut of camel&rsquo;s hair with red and blue. <i>Knot</i>,
  Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally, six to nine;
  perpendicularly, eight to twelve. The rows of knots are firmly
  pressed down. <i>Warp</i>, cotton; each of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back. <i>Weft</i>,
  generally cotton, frequently wool; of coarse diameter. A thread
  of weft crosses only once without slack between every two rows of
  knots, so that the white spots of transverse cotton warp exposed
  at back have a quincunx appearance. <i>Pile</i>, in old rugs,
  mostly camel&rsquo;s hair and some wool; in recent rugs, mostly
  wool clipped short. <i>Border</i>, wide, generally of three or
  four stripes, and a broad outer edging of camel&rsquo;s hair.
  <i>Sides</i>, overcast, generally in brown or red. <i>Lower
  end</i>, a narrow web and warp loops. <i>Upper end</i>, a narrow
  web turned back and hemmed. <i>Texture</i>, very firm.
  <i>Weave</i>, at back is of moderately coarse grain.
  <i>Length</i>, three to twenty-four feet. <i>Width</i>, two
  fifths to three quarters length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Irans.</span>&mdash;Although
  neither a city nor district of Persia is called Iran, a
  well-defined class of rugs is known to the trade by that name.
  They are woven by some of the old Iranian stock dwelling
  principally in the province of Irak-Ajemi. These people follow no
  particular pattern or colour scheme of their own, but to a large
  extent copy those of a few well-known Persian classes; yet in
  other respects their rugs have a noticeable individuality. They
  are woven with a Ghiordes knot and so loosely that if the rug be
  observed from the front, as it is bent backward in a plane
  parallel to the direction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125"
  id="Page_125">125</a></span> of the weft, the foundation threads
  of warp and weft, which are of cotton, will show distinctly
  between the knots. Each of the two threads of warp encircled by a
  single knot are equally prominent at the back. Ordinarily the
  threads of weft cross twice between the rows of knots, but
  occasionally they cross only once, as in Hamadans. Many of the
  fabrics regarded as Sarabends, Feraghans, and even Hamadans are
  in reality Irans, which on account of their inferior workmanship
  are much less valuable.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally blue
  and red, with minor quantities of ivory, yellow, green, and
  brown. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally, six to
  eleven; perpendicularly, seven to eleven. A half knot as it
  appears at back is frequently longer, measured in the direction
  of the length of the rug, than wide. The rows of knots are not
  pressed down closely, so that the warp is noticeable at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, cotton; each of the two threads encircled by a knot
  is equally prominent at back; they are not closely strung, so
  that each half knot stands out distinctly. <i>Weft</i>, cotton; a
  thread of weft of coarse diameter as a rule crosses twice between
  each two rows of knots, and only rarely crosses but once. The
  weft is conspicuous between the knots at front when the rug is
  bent backwards. <i>Pile</i>, wool of medium length.
  <i>Border</i>, generally four to six stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a
  heavy double overcasting that is generally brown or black, but
  sometimes red. <i>Lower end</i>, a narrow web. <i>Upper end</i>,
  a narrow web and loose warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, loose.
  <i>Weave</i> at back is of coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>,
  five to ten feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two fifths to three
  quarters length.</p>

  Here, shaded by poplars, are clustered one hundred and fifty
  houses, with floors, roofs, and sides of mud that has dried and
  cracked until it admits the wind. The sun and light enter through
  the open doors, for there are no windows. Nor are there chimneys,
  but simply openings between the rafters to permit the escape of
  smoke from the open fireplace in the floor below and the entrance
  of more wind. At times the atmosphere is not only oppressive with
  smoke, but is laden with odours that arise from the pens beneath
  and beside the houses, where fowls, sheep, and goats are huddled.
  During the winter and early spring snow lies on the ground; a
  little later a hot summer follows. Yet amid these de<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>pressing
  surroundings and under these adverse conditions lived weavers who
  gave the name of their little village to some of the most
  beautiful rugs made in all the East.</p>

  <p>Now and then is seen an old piece with surface like velvet and
  with mellowed tones of perfect harmony that has come from these
  huts or surrounding hills; but probably not one in a score,
  perhaps not one in a hundred, of the Sarouks now offered for sale
  in this country was woven there, as most of them are made in the
  workhouses of larger cities, though they follow essentially the
  general appearance and technique of old and genuine pieces, even
  if lacking some of their best qualities. Nevertheless, the modern
  pieces are of handsome colour, of graceful pattern, and are well
  woven. Some of them, which were made two or three decades ago,
  had large designs of the cypress, willow, or the tree of life, as
  well as realistically drawn animals represented in the fields;
  but the great majority of those now seen invariably follow a
  pattern consisting of a large medallion with pendants, or of two
  or more concentric medallions resting on the field, from which
  are set off the four corners. Defining the edges of both
  medallions and corners are lines that are most artistically
  irregular, yet correspond with one another.</p>

  <p>Between each part is the greatest co-ordination, for the
  designs of field, corners, medallions, and borders are similar.
  On long delicate stems that bend and interlock like carved
  tracery are leaves, buds, and flowers, suggesting the
  craftsmanship of the best days of old Iran. The borders generally
  have only three stripes: a broad main stripe on which appears an
  elaborately drawn undulating vine with pendent flowers, and a
  narrow guard stripe on each side. Sometimes the guards are
  ornamented with only a simple vine, but more frequently with a
  reciprocal pattern, which, however, is so well drawn as to
  conflict in no wise with the harmony of the floral forms. In the
  drawing of the borders the weavers exercise greater latitude than
  in any other part of the rug; for occasionally they add a narrow
  outer edging of dark colour, place the reciprocal figure next to
  the innermost stripe as a fringe to the field, or increase the
  number of stripes to seven. Rarely is the medallion wanting in
  modern pieces, but now and then the pendants are replaced by
  bunches of flowers, and in some pieces the corners extend along
  the sides in undulating lines until they meet near the
  centre.</p>

  <p>All of these pieces are so closely woven that the fine bluish
  weft is hardly discernible at the back. Very few other rugs have
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id=
  "Page_127">127</a></span>such short-cut wool, which has a velvety
  appearance, rendered more effective by the soft, rich colours
  that are always in perfect harmony and excellent taste. As a rule
  they are dark. Ever present in the ground colours are deep blues
  and reds, suggestive of the hues of the so-called
  &ldquo;Ispahans;&rdquo; while olives, delicate greens, and ivory
  represent with consummate dignity of tone and design a lavish
  tracery of leaves and foliage motives.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dark
  blue and red, with minor quantities of green, olive, buff, and
  ivory. <i>Knot</i>, Sehna. Knots to inch horizontally twelve to
  eighteen; perpendicularly, twelve to twenty. The rows of knots
  are pressed down, so that the warp is concealed and the weft is
  partly hidden at back. <i>Warp</i>, cotton, rarely linen; one of
  the two threads encircled by a knot is almost always doubled
  under the other; in a few pieces it is only depressed.
  <i>Weft</i>, cotton, of small diameter, dyed blue. A thread of
  weft of fine diameter crosses twice between every two rows of
  knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, short and velvety. <i>Border</i>,
  generally of three stripes but sometimes as many as seven.
  Occasionally there is an outer edging of dark colour.
  <i>Sides</i>, a tightly wound double overcasting of red, blue, or
  black wool. <i>Both ends</i>, a narrow web, or web and short warp
  fringe. <i>Texture</i>, very firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of
  fine grain. <i>Length</i>, four to twelve feet. <i>Width</i>, two

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Kashans.</span>&mdash;Near the
  centre of the province of Irak-Ajemi, on the ancient and
  well-travelled highway between Ispahan and Teheran, is the city
  of Kashan, from which, according to an old tradition, the three
  Wise Men of the East followed the Star of Bethlehem. Like many of
  the cities of Persia it is now largely in ruins; its homes are
  infested with scorpions; for many months of the year the heat,
  which in a measure is due to the proximity of the great salt
  desert that extends far into Khorassan, is unendurable; yet in
  spite of these inconveniences, for which perhaps familiarity has
  in a measure lent contempt, forty thousand people live there. In
  the past it has produced some of the greatest artists and
  artisans of weaving. It was once the home of Maksoud, whom Shah
  Ismael I ordered to weave the famous carpet of the Mosque of
  Ardebil, which, ranking among the greatest woven products that
  still exist, bears unmistakable evidence of the wonderful
  technique and artistic skill then practised in Kashan. Without a
  doubt other textile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id=
  "Page_128">128</a></span> masterpieces of the XVI and XVII
  Centuries were woven there, for it would be unreasonable to
  believe that the city where Maksoud had learned his art was not
  at that time a prominent rug-producing centre.</p>

  <p>According to Persian tradition many of the antique silk
  carpets came from Kashan. At any rate, it has been for a long
  time customary to take the raw silk from other places to be spun
  and dyed there. Some of it is woven into rugs, which are
  considered among the best of modern pieces, though the demand for
  them is small.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the woollen pieces are now found in every
  market, though it is only within recent years that they have been
  generally known. Occasionally they are defined as a higher grade
  of Sarouks, on account of the striking resemblance in texture,
  colours, and designs; yet there are certain distinctions: the
  warp is often linen, the nap is a little shorter, the texture
  slightly firmer, and there are a great number of border stripes.
  A feature that is more frequently found in these two classes than
  in any other is the fringe of hooks or short comb-like teeth that
  border the innermost stripe and extend into the field. Without
  doubt Kashans are among the most perfect as well as the most
  expensive woollen products of the modern Persian looms. Their
  velvet-like surface and rich sheen give them an appearance that
  to those unfamiliar with rugs seems like that of silken pieces.
  The fine wool is dyed with rich, deep tones of blue, olive, red,
  and brown; the perfectly balanced pattern is artistic as well as
  ornate; and on account of the very short nap the drawing of each
  minute detail is clear. In place of bold designs accentuated by
  masses of colour are delicate tracings of floral and foliage
  motives, of graceful arabesques and foliated stalks, so expressed
  in rhythmic lines and harmonious tones as to give a sense of the
  greatest refinement. Even though these rugs be modern and
  chemically washed, their wealth of artistic workmanship and
  exquisite colour make them exceedingly handsome.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dark
  blue, red, and yellowish brown, with minor quantities of light
  blue and green. <i>Knot</i>, Sehna. Knots to inch horizontally
  sixteen to twenty; perpendicularly, sixteen to twenty-four. The
  rows of knots are firmly pressed down so that the warp is
  concealed and the weft almost hidden at back. <i>Warp</i>,
  generally cotton, rarely linen; one of the two threads encircled
  by a knot is doubled under the other. <i>Weft</i>, generally
  cotton, of small diameter, dyed blue; rarely linen. A<span class=

  generally of seven stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a tightly wound double
  overcasting in dark red, blue, or brown. <i>Lower end</i>, a
  narrow web. <i>Upper end</i>, a narrow web and short warp fringe.
  <i>Texture</i>, very firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of very fine
  grain. <i>Usual length</i>, six to ten feet. <i>Usual width</i>,

  <p class="tb"><span class=
  "smcap">Sababends.</span>&mdash;Standing on the top of lofty
  Elwund, that rises on the boundary between the provinces of
  Ardelan and Irak-Ajemi, in Northwestern Persia, one would see
  within a radius of ninety miles as prolific a centre of rug
  weaving as anywhere exists. Just within this distance to the
  northwest are Sehna and Bijar, to the southeast is Sultanabad, to
  the southwest is Kermanshah; and skirting the mountain on the
  eastern side are the high plains where lie the districts of
  Hamadan, Feraghan, and Sarawan, as well as the village of Sarouk
  and less important centres of weaving.</p>

  <p>Among the valleys of the Sarawan district, that lies on the
  northern flanks of mountain ranges extending as far as Ispahan,
  are made the rugs which, by a corruption of the word Sarawan, are
  known as the Sarabends. No other rugs of Persia have a pattern
  that is so simple, and that for generations has been followed
  with so little variation. Nor are there any other modern rugs
  that have changed less from the old styles in respect to colour
  and quality. The typical pattern of the field consists of rows of
  pear designs arranged in transverse lines, with the smaller ends
  pointing in different directions in alternate lines. The pears of
  the field show great diversity of shape, but those of the borders
  are long, narrow, and most angular; yet they never assume the
  rectilinear figures found in Baku rugs. Only very rarely is there
  any departure from this pattern; though in a few old pieces is an
  adaptation of the Herati design, and now and then is seen a
  geometric figure, or human form, or the date when the piece was
  woven.</p>

  <p>The ground colour of the field may be blue, red, or white. If
  blue, it is so largely covered with pinkish or rose-coloured
  pears that the prevailing hue, when the pieces are viewed from a
  distance, is light red. If, on the other hand, the field is red,
  the pears are mostly blue; and if the field is ivory white, the
  pears are red and blue. In all old pieces the blue has rich, deep
  tones, the red has mellowed into soft rose or delicate pink, and
  the white has turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id=
  "Page_130">130</a></span> to ivory. This pleasing effect is
  increased by shades of yellow and green, which are added to the
  other colours of the pears.</p>

  <p>With few exceptions the borders have a large number of narrow
  stripes, of which the central is about one third the aggregate
  width. Its ground colour is ivory white, but the angular vine and
  pendent, narrow pears have the same colours as those of the
  field. On each side of it is usually a stripe with ground colour
  corresponding to that of the field and with an undulating vine
  and rosette. Almost invariably there is an outer stripe of
  reciprocal trefoil in red and blue, which may be balanced by a
  reciprocal sawtooth adjoining the field. It is not unusual to see
  large pieces with two white stripes, and very rarely one is seen
  with three.</p>

  <p>The best of these pieces are made in the town of Mirabad,
  which signifies the &ldquo;city of Mir,&rdquo; and are
  accordingly called Mir-Sarabends. They can be distinguished from
  others, known to the trade as Royal Sarabends, by the fact that
  in tying the knots the yarn is so twisted that one thread of warp
  is doubled under the other; and in the latter each of the two
  threads appear with equal prominence at the back. Neither of them
  should ever be mistaken for Iran imitations, in which the pile is
  of much looser texture and is tied with the Ghiordes knot. For
  durability, there are very few modern pieces that will give the
  satisfaction of Sarabends; for as a rule they are stoutly and
  closely woven, and though there is monotony in the pattern, those
  coloured with vegetable dyes will grow more beautiful with
  age.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red
  or blue, with minor quantities of ivory, yellow, and green.
  <i>Knot</i>, Sehna. Knots to inch horizontally eight to thirteen;
  perpendicularly, nine to thirteen. The rows of knots are firmly
  pressed down, so that the warp does not show at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, cotton. In Mir-Sarabends one of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is doubled under the other at back. In Royal
  Sarabends each is equally prominent. <i>Weft</i>, cotton, of fine
  diameter, and dyed red or blue. A thread of weft crosses twice
  between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool of short or
  medium length. <i>Border</i>, five to seven stripes, and
  occasionally even more. <i>Sides</i>, a red double overcasting.
  <i>Lower end</i>, a web, or web and short warp fringe. <i>Upper
  end</i>, a web and short warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, firm.
  <i>Weave</i> at back is of moderately fine grain. <i>Length</i>,
  five to eighteen feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two fifths to two
  thirds length.</p>

  <h4><i>COLOUR PLATE V&mdash;GHIORDES PRAYER RUG</i></h4>

  <p><i>Only now and then is seen a prayer Ghiordes that represents
  such a high type of artistic skill. The weaving follows more
  closely the fine technique of the Persian than that of the Asia
  Minor weaver. Yet it is the drawing and colouring that claim
  attention. The delicate tracery of the spandrel, the minute
  delineation of tendril and leaf in the border, and the perfect
  balance of every part of one side with a corresponding part in
  the other, resemble the finest workmanship of old Iran. Not only
  so, but the beautiful border pattern of rosette and leaf is so
  suggestive of the well-known Herati design that it seems not
  improbable that here is shown the influence of those Persian
  weavers that Solyman the Magnificent took with him to Asia Minor
  after his capture of Tabriz. The colour also displays dainty
  tones and careful shading found in no other class of Asia Minor
  rugs. Such pieces are usually regarded as products of the XVI
  Century.</i></p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Burujirds</span>.&mdash;About
  sixty miles to the west of Sultanabad and forty to the south of
  the Sarawan district is the city of Burujird. It is in a rich,
  well-watered valley and is surrounded by numerous hamlets. Most
  of the population are engaged in agriculture; and only a small
  part, who are stimulated by the increased prices occasioned by
  the rug industry of Sultanabad, are weavers. They produce pieces
  that resemble closely the Sarabend rugs, as the field is
  generally occupied with pear designs; but on account of the
  Ghiordes knot and cotton warp and weft, they might be mistaken
  for Iran rugs.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class=
  "smcap">Sultanabads</span>.&mdash;Southeastward from the plain of
  Feraghan is the city of Sultanabad, which in recent years has
  become important as the centre of a great rug industry controlled
  by Europeans and Americans. Higher prices, resulting from the
  constantly increasing Western demand for Persian rugs, have
  stimulated the native weavers to more persistent efforts. Those
  who are too poor to purchase wool and dyes<a name="FNanchor_24"
  id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class=
  "fnanchor">24</a> are supplied by the companies. Others, who are
  more dependent, are paid regular wages. Thus it happens that not
  only large numbers of looms are constantly at work in the city,
  but a hundred hamlets and villages that lie within a day&rsquo;s
  journey produce rugs that are marketed there. But while the
  output has been increased the true artistic spirit has been
  suppressed, and patterns favoured or supplied by foreign
  purchasers only are in demand. Most of the rugs are well woven,
  though there is a difference in grades. Some take the name of the
  city, others are called Savalans, from a range of mountains that
  lie to the north, and others are known as Mahals. Most of them
  are large pieces, rather coarsely woven.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Muskabads</span>.&mdash;In the
  district of Muskabad, a short distance to the northwest of
  Sultanabad, are produced rugs very similar to the Mahals. They
  come in the same large carpet sizes and nearly square shapes;
  they have almost the same harmonious colour scheme of unobtrusive
  red, yellow, blue, green, and ivory; they have the same cotton
  warp and weft, the same finish of sides and ends; but as a rule
  they are less closely woven. The patterns are varied.
  Occasionally they have large figures such as are seen in
  Gorevans, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id=
  "Page_132">132</a></span> though these are more usual in Mahals.
  In some of them the field is covered with conventionalised leaf
  and floral form. But the usual type has two or more concentric
  medallions of different colours covered with the small Herati
  designs so distinctive of the Feraghans. When such is the case,
  the border has usually the turtle pattern in the main stripe and
  some stiffly drawn vine and floral pattern in the smaller
  stripes. But the velvety appearance, the elegant finish of old
  Feraghans, is always lacking. The nap is of soft wool of medium
  length, but the surface of the back displays coarse texture.
  These pieces lack the artistic qualities of most Persian rugs;
  but on account of their excellent quality of material and
  stoutness of weave they are very serviceable.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  blue, and ivory, with minor quantities of green and brown.
  <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes or Sehna. Knots to inch horizontally seven
  to fourteen; perpendicularly, eight to twelve. The rows of knots
  are not firmly pressed down. <i>Warp</i>, cotton; one of the two
  threads encircled by a knot is generally depressed at back, and
  frequently nearly doubled under the other. <i>Weft</i>, cotton,
  of medium to coarse diameter. A thread of weft crosses twice
  between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium
  length. <i>Border</i>, three to five stripes, with a narrow outer
  edging. <i>Sides</i>, a double overcasting. <i>Lower end</i>, a
  very narrow web and short warp fringe. <i>Upper end</i>, short
  warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, moderately firm. <i>Weave</i> at
  back is of very coarse grain. <i>Length</i>, ten to eighteen
  feet. <i>Width</i>, two thirds to seven eighths length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Joshaghans</span>.&mdash;Lying
  to the southeast of Sultanabad and to the north of Ispahan is a
  district where a century ago were woven some of the best carpets
  of Persia, known as Joshaghans or Djushghans. Even long before
  then it was noted for its textile fabrics; but during the reign
  of Nadir Shah, who removed many of the best artisans from the
  central to the northwestern part of Persia, the carpet weaving
  received a new impulse, and continued to flourish there until
  nearly the middle of the last century. Since that time it has
  almost ceased, so that the genuine Joshaghans of rich, deep
  colour and skilfully drawn pattern are all sixty or more years of
  age. They may still be found scattered throughout the country,
  and should be carefully preserved; for they merit the high esteem
  accorded to them by the Persians themselves.</p>

  <p>In a few of these pieces are seen the Shah Abbas pattern. In
  other <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id=
  "Page_133">133</a></span>pieces the field is covered with
  scrolls, or with a lattice-work pattern in which small floral
  forms are the motives. Again it is occupied by pear designs
  encircled by small rounded figures, which combined form the
  outlines of a larger pear, while in the intervening spaces are
  small floral forms. The principal border stripe generally
  consists of floral designs, which not infrequently are some form
  of the Herati pattern. The secondary stripes often contain floral
  vines.</p>

  <p>Whatever the pattern of the field, the effect is always
  striking and beautiful; for the lines are never harsh, and the
  colours are rich. The ground is very frequently a rose tint, but
  is sometimes dark blue; and the overlying designs are rose,
  yellow, green, and ivory. The colours of the border are generally
  the same as those of the smaller designs, so that the effect is
  always harmonious. These rugs are excellently woven; and the soft
  lustrous wool of the pile, which is usually longer than that of
  Sarabends and Feraghans, has often an appearance like plush.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red
  and blue, with lesser quantities of yellow, green, brown, and
  ivory. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally seven to
  eleven; perpendicularly, eight to thirteen. The rows of knots are
  not always firmly pressed down, so that the warp may be seen at
  back. <i>Warp</i>, usually cotton, occasionally wool; one of the
  two threads encircled by a knot is usually depressed below the
  other at the back. <i>Weft</i>, wool, sometimes dyed red, brown,
  or reddish brown, but frequently of natural colour. A thread of
  weft generally crosses twice, but sometimes three times between
  every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool of short or medium
  length. <i>Border</i>, usually three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a
  double overcasting that is generally brown or black. <i>Lower
  end</i>, a web. <i>Upper end</i>, a web and warp fringe.
  <i>Texture</i>, moderately firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of
  moderately fine grain. <i>Usual length</i>, eight to sixteen
  feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two fifths to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Sehnas.</span>&mdash;Seldom has
  prophecy been more precisely fulfilled than the one made a decade
  ago that the old Persian rugs would rapidly disappear from the
  market. Nor is it better exemplified than in the case of those
  woven before the middle of the last century in Sehna, capital of
  Ardelan, for to-day it is exceedingly difficult to obtain any of
  them. Nevertheless, there are still many looms among the four or
  five thousand families of the city, where true to early
  traditions are woven modern fabrics that maintain the
  same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id=
  "Page_134">134</a></span> floral Persian patterns, the same
  colour, the same general character of weave; but they lack the
  fine technique of the older pieces. It is, indeed, surprising
  that these modern pieces so closely resemble the old in all save
  quality, when it is considered that Sehna is distant only fifty
  miles from the western border of Persia; that it is surrounded by
  Kurdish tribes who for generations have woven rugs with nomadic
  features; and that it is not far distant from other important rug
  centres.</p>

  <p>To one familiar with the leading characteristics it is
  possible at once to distinguish these rugs. Their nap is
  exceedingly short, and the weave is so distinctive that with eyes
  closed an expert will generally recognise them after rubbing the
  hand across the front and back. Their patterns, also, conform to
  well-established types, yet have sufficient variety to be always
  interesting. They may be conveniently divided into two groups:
  one represents the entire field covered with floral designs, and
  the other represents a field of uniform colour with a medallion
  at the centre, or with two or more concentric medallions. The
  former, which is undoubtedly the older group, has generally a
  small diaper pattern of the Herati design or floral figures
  daintily drawn. To obviate too great monotony, a number of the
  old pieces have the leaves and flowers so adjusted that the
  ground conveys the effect of lattice work, or less often have
  small trees of cypress regularly placed amid the other floral
  designs. Again, the field may be covered with large pear designs
  placed in rows. Of modern pieces the most beautiful pattern, as a
  rule, consists of a field of rich, uniform colour, as ivory or
  red, containing at its centre a single medallion of contrasting
  ground colour, which is generally dark blue or even black. The
  four corners of the field have serrated edges and are covered
  with floral designs similar to those of the medallion. The
  borders, which are invariably narrow, usually consist of three
  stripes, but sometimes of only two. With very few exceptions they
  are floral, and in the main one, that has a ground colour of
  yellow or red, are represented designs which are also similar to
  those of the medallion. Some of the old Sehnas had borders that
  were less floral than more modern pieces, and the turtle design
  so common to Feraghans was often used. Isolated and adventitious
  designs, such as are seen in all nomadic rugs, are never found in
  these pieces, nor are the floriated scrolls that are peculiar to
  Sarouks, Kashans, and Kermanshahs.</p>

  <p>As is seldom the case with modern rugs, occasionally both
  linen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id=
  "Page_135">135</a></span> and silk are used for the warp, and
  silk for overcasting, but generally the warp is cotton and the
  overcasting is of wool. The city of Sehna has given its name to
  the kind of knot with which almost all the rugs of China and
  Turkestan as well as many of the rugs of India and Persia are
  tied; yet strange as it may seem, its own weavers have been
  inconsistent in its use. To be sure, most of its rugs have the
  Sehna knot, but a surprisingly large proportion of both recent
  and comparatively old pieces have the Ghiordes knot. Only a few
  other rugs ever adopt the same style of weaving; for a thread of
  weft passes between two rows of knots but once, so that at the
  back only alternate threads of white cotton warp appear between
  these knots and thus give to the weave a checkered appearance or
  quincunx effect. Moreover, the yarn of the knots is not drawn
  tightly against the warp, so that in whatever direction the hand
  is rubbed the surface feels like a file. Very few other rugs are
  so closely woven, as four hundred knots to the square inch are
  not uncommon; and in very old pieces nearly double that number
  are now and then met with. Since both warp and weft are of fine
  threads and the nap is very short, these rugs are exceedingly
  thin and, accordingly, are not well adapted for floor use.</p>

  <p>Some old saddle-bags are still to be found, rich in their
  fields of deep blues and floral forms of brighter tones, but
  unfortunately they are somewhat marred by the long slit in the
  centre made to fit the saddle.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dark
  blue, red, and ivory, with lesser quantities of green, light
  blue, and yellow. <i>Knot</i>, Sehna, often Ghiordes. Knots to
  inch horizontally eleven to twenty; perpendicularly, twelve to
  twenty-four. The rows of knots are closely pressed down, but the
  yarn of knots is not drawn tight against the warp. <i>Warp</i>,
  generally cotton, occasionally linen, rarely silk. Each of the
  two threads encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back.
  <i>Weft</i>, generally cotton, occasionally wool or linen, rarely
  silk. A single thread of small diameter crosses only once between
  every two rows of knots, so that the white spots of transverse
  warp exposed at back have a quincunx appearance. <i>Pile</i>,
  wool clipped very short. <i>Border</i>, three stripes.
  <i>Sides</i>, a tightly wound double overcasting. <i>Lower
  end</i>, a short web, or web and warp loops, or web and short
  warp fringe. <i>Upper end</i>, short web and fringe.
  <i>Texture</i>, very firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of fine grain
  but very rough. <i>Length</i>, three to seven feet. <i>Width</i>,
  two thirds to three quarters length.</p>

  "smcap">Bijars.</span>&mdash;One hundred miles beyond Hamadan, on
  the road to Tabriz, is the city of Bijar, capital of the district
  of Gehrous. It is surrounded by barren mountains that rise out of
  high table-lands, where for miles scarcely a habitation or bush
  breaks the monotony, and where not even a blade of grass or
  flower brightens the cracked and sun-parched earth, except for a
  short season of the year. As is the case throughout nearly all
  Persia, the spirit of desolation has crept into the city; the
  grapevine climbs over ruined walls; the shade of poplars and
  willows falls alike on decaying palace and crumbling houses. Yet
  there still remain caravansaries, schools, and mosques, as well
  as a population of five thousand people. Without doubt the
  importance of the city is partly due to the regiment of soldiers
  that the governor maintains to keep in subjection the bands of
  robbers and fierce Kurds who, in large numbers, live throughout
  the surrounding country. Nor are they the only tribes of fierce
  foreign blood dwelling in this region; for it is stated that
  during the invasions of the Timurids, a body of Turkomans from
  the fortress town of old Saraks, where the corners of Persia and
  Afghanistan meet Turkestan, followed the conqueror westward and
  settled here. After them is named a small river that flows a
  short distance to the north and finally empties into Lake
  Urumiah; and it is not unusual to apply the name Saraks to the
  rugs woven about Bijar, though they have none of the Turkoman
  characteristics.</p>

  <p>By adopting some of the best qualities of both Persian and
  Kurdish rugs, the Bijar weavers have produced pieces of unusual
  merit. The foundation is generally of wool; but unlike almost all
  other rugs with nomadic features one thread of warp to each knot
  is doubled beneath the other in the process of weaving, so that
  it is almost or entirely concealed. Bijars are accordingly pieces
  of great firmness and durability. Moreover, their threads of warp
  and weft are of coarse diameter, so that they are invariably
  thick even when the nap is not long. They are also distinctive in
  the effective massing of bright and strong colours. Perhaps the
  association with ranges of treeless hills, with salt wastes, with
  vast plains where rainless months leave the grass parched and the
  flowers withered, has deadened the Persian love for the
  brilliant, joyous colours so acutely cherished in other parts of
  Asia; but by the weavers of Bijar it is not unusual to discard
  many of the Persian colours, which, however rich, are subdued and
  sombre, and adopt the brighter hues <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>seen in
  some of the rugs of Asia Minor. Yet, as is not always the case
  with the latter, there is no sense of outraged taste; and though
  crimson reds, deep blues, or tawny camel&rsquo;s hair be brought
  in relief against a field of strongly contrasting colour, the
  effect, except in modern pieces of poor dyes, is never
  displeasing.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the pattern much latitude is exercised, but only in the
  oldest pieces are found the gracefully flowing lines suggestive
  of the highest Persian art. In many pieces a central medallion
  and triangular-shaped corners, separated by a field of plain or
  slightly shaded colour, is a favourite pattern. But the defining
  lines are severe, and lack the delicate drawing characteristic of
  Kermanshahs and Sarouks. Or the field may be covered with a
  lattice-work pattern that contains small repetitive forms,
  consisting of slender stems supporting one or more flowers.
  Frequently a rug is covered with a medley of designs composed of
  conventionalised flowers, crudely drawn trees, as well as birds,
  animals, or human beings. The borders generally consist of an
  outer edging of plain colour, and three stripes, on which are
  often represented purely geometric forms, but more frequently the
  undulating vine and pendent leaves, such as are common to most
  Persian rugs. Fortunately many sterling pieces still remain that
  have none of the earmarks of factory-made rugs, but are beautiful
  with their soft wool and lustrous colours, as well as interesting
  with their blending of Persian and Kurdish features.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  also blue, ivory, green, yellow, and chocolate. <i>Knot</i>,
  Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally six to ten; perpendicularly,
  eight to twelve. The rows of knots are pressed down, so that the
  warp is concealed at back and the weft partly hidden.
  <i>Warp</i>, wool; one of the two threads encircled by a knot is
  doubled under the other. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of medium or coarse
  diameter, frequently dyed red. A thread of weft crosses twice
  between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, of medium length,
  usually wool, but frequently partly of camel&rsquo;s hair.
  <i>Border</i>, of three stripes, often with an outer edging.
  <i>Sides</i>, a double overcasting in red or purple. <i>Lower
  end</i>, a web that is occasionally coloured or a narrow braided
  selvage. <i>Upper end</i>, a web with loose warp fringe and
  sometimes a braided selvage. The webbing is occasionally turned
  back and hemmed. <i>Texture</i>, very firm. <i>Weave</i> at back
  is of coarse grain. <i>Length</i>, six to sixteen feet.

  "smcap">Kermanshahs.</span>&mdash;On an ancient highway between
  Bagdad and Teheran is the city of Kermanshah. As it is situated
  near the frontiers of northwestern Persia, facing the Turkish
  provinces, and is surrounded by mountains where once wandered
  bands of homeless marauding Kurds who recognised no government,
  it was formerly a most important stronghold of defence. A century
  ago Robert Kerr Porter, who visited the city, referred to the
  luxurious gardens and orchards that surrounded it, and to the
  villages of the vicinity in which were made &ldquo;carpets of
  most beautiful colour and fabric.&rdquo; Within later years the
  moat has filled with rubbish, the encircling walls have crumbled,
  and the deserted bazaars and caravansaries show that its present
  population of about twelve thousand is but a small part of what
  it has been. With its decline in political importance followed a
  decline in industrial activities; yet for a long time it remained
  a rug-producing centre of importance. In 1880 Sir George Birdwood
  wrote that &ldquo;the finest Oriental rugs of our time, which at
  the Vienna Exhibition astonished all beholders, are those made in
  the palace of the Governor of Kermanshah, in Kurdistan, and are
  only disposed of as presents.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_25" id=
  "FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
  And in 1890 a traveller<a name="FNanchor_26" id=
  "FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
  spoke of the weaving as follows: &ldquo;It is a process carried
  on in homes, hovels, and tents by women and children.... The
  vegetable dyes used are soft and artistic, especially a wonderful
  red and the various shades of indigo. The dull, rich tints, even
  when new, are quite beautiful. The women pursue their work
  chiefly in odds and ends of time, and in some cases make it much
  of a pastime.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>From this city and the surrounding hills are still obtained
  large quantities of rugs, which follow the same patterns that for
  years have been characteristic of this district. Yet most of the
  modern Kermanshahs are made elsewhere in the workhouses of
  exporting companies. So noticeable is the resemblance in drawing
  and colouring of some of them to the Kirmans of Southeastern
  Persia, that they are offered now and then by dealers as real
  Kirmans, though they lack the fine technique and artistic merit
  of the latter. They possess, however, the same wealth of floral
  expression, for throughout border and field are sprays of flowers
  on delicate vines and foliate stalks. Most of the pieces now seen
  contain at the centre of the field a large medallion, which may
  have serrated or lobed edges, be oval or of diamond shape, and
  with or without pendants. The corners are</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id=
  "Page_139">139</a></span></p>

  <p>defined by lines that do not always conform to those of the
  medallion; and the borders have always several stripes, of which
  the main one is usually but little wider than the others. In all
  these different parts are floral and foliage motives that find
  expression in sunflowers, roses, tulips, daisies, and many
  simpler forms, supported by delicate branching sprays and
  vines.</p>

  <p>There are, however, other patterns less frequently met with,
  as it is not unusual to see elaborate pear designs, and sometimes
  the cypress or the palm tree naturalistically drawn. Covering the
  field of a rare old Kermanshah recently seen were thirty large
  panels, which like so many small rugs contained central fields
  that were alternately coloured blue and ivory. Surrounding each
  of these little fields, on which were represented the arch of a
  temple and the tree of life, were borders wherein were woven
  verses from the Koran, and at the intersections of the borders
  were floral designs like roses. Encircling all the panels was a
  wide border containing escutcheons in which were woven other
  verses. Without doubt this rug was used for sacred purposes. In
  fact, a larger proportion of Kermanshahs than almost any other
  Persian rugs have prayer arches as well as verses from the Koran
  inscribed in some part of them, but with very few exceptions they
  are recently woven and bear no evidence of devotional usage.</p>

  <p>The general colour scheme is distinctive, for the tones are
  much lighter than those of most other Persian rugs. Frequently a
  field of ivory surrounds the central medallion, though sometimes
  a light rose red is used. Other colours are light blue, green,
  and buff, which are softened by the floccy quality of the
  excellent and moderately short-clipped wool. One feature common
  to almost all of them is the narrow edging of pinkish red that
  surrounds the border. This edging, the foliate scrolls, the soft
  light tones, and the rather coarse weaving, that leaves the white
  or sometimes pinkish weft exposed at the back, are
  characteristics by which these rugs may readily be distinguished.
  As they come in all sizes from small mats to large carpets, and
  have tones that harmonise with almost any surroundings, they are
  a most popular class with those who care little for association
  and ignore the fact that they are chemically washed.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally light
  rose and ivory, also blue, green, and buff. <i>Knot</i>, Sehna.
  Knots to inch horizontally twelve to eighteen, perpendicularly
  eleven to eighteen. The rows<span class='pagenum'><a name=

  down, so that the warp is concealed at back, but the weft is
  conspicuous. <i>Warp</i>, cotton; one of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is doubled under the other. <i>Weft</i>,
  cotton, of medium diameter, sometimes dyed pink. A thread of weft
  crosses twice between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool,
  soft and of medium length. <i>Border</i>, frequently of three

  an outer edging that is generally red, but occasionally blue.
  <i>Sides</i>, a double overcasting in same colour as edging.
  <i>Lower end</i>, a narrow web and warp loops, or short warp

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Western
  Kurdistans.</span>&mdash;Within the land lying between the
  Anti-Taurus and Zagros mountains, where the Euphrates and Tigris
  rivers have their sources, dwell a people almost as untamed as
  when in the dawn of history they were designated the
  &ldquo;Warriors;&rdquo; or centuries later, under the name
  &ldquo;Carduchis,&rdquo; opposed the retreat of Xenophon and his
  ten thousand Greeks. Now they are known as &ldquo;Kurds,&rdquo;
  of whom large numbers, wild, brave, and hospitable, live a
  nomadic life among table-lands partly covered with sycamores and
  oaks, or follow their sheep over lofty pine-crowned mountains,
  that for long months are enveloped in snow. Doubtless the
  cheering influence of green hillsides and the rich vegetation of
  innumerable valleys, where streams flow perennially, is in a
  measure responsible for their more sprightly aspect when
  contrasted with that of the Persians. They recognise no law but
  the will of their chief, to whom they maintain strictest fealty.
  &ldquo;There was up to a recent period no more picturesque or
  interesting scene to be witnessed in the East than the court of
  one of these great Kurdish chiefs, where, like another Saladin,
  the bey ruled in patriarchial state, surrounded by his clansmen
  with reverence and affection, and attended by a body-guard of
  young Kurdish warriors, clad in chain armor, with flaunting
  silken scarfs, and bearing javelin, lance, and sword, as in the
  time of the Crusades.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_27" id=

  <p>Large numbers, also, are settled in Persia, where they
  cultivate the soil of small tracts of land, or live in villages
  of stone houses. Many of them are scattered around Lake Urumiah.
  Others have made their homes in the district of Kermanshah, and
  not a few have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id=
  "Page_141">141</a></span>wandered as far as Khorassan. But
  wherever they may be, they are distinguished by their appearance;
  for the men are bold and handsome, and the young women, whom
  custom permits to appear unveiled in public, are beautiful as
  well as graceful.</p>

  <p>There is no racial distinction between the Kurds who live the
  pastoral life and those who dwell in villages, or between the
  Kurds of Asiatic Turkey and those of Persia; yet environment has
  produced a marked difference in their textile fabrics. Those
  woven by the tribes that live among the mountains that encircle
  Lake Van and extend to the north of Diarbekr embody the wild
  characteristics of the weavers. They are strong and coarse, with
  close weave, long nap, and bold patterns, that suggest Caucasian
  influence devoid of artistic feeling. In some of them is a large
  central diamond or lozenge surrounded by latch-hooks, as well as
  floral forms so conventionalised as to be purely geometric; now
  and then Arabic symbols and letters are scattered over the field.
  Moreover, the colours lack the delicate shades of Persian rugs,
  but possess rich, strong hues obtained from native dyes that
  applied to the excellent wool give it a warm, lustrous
  appearance. Brown is very largely used. There are also dark reds
  and blues brightened by dashes of white and yellow. Only the
  Kazaks, Tcherkess, and one or two Asia Minor weaves are trimmed
  with such long nap, which, together with the deep colours and
  long shaggy fringe, give these pieces a semi-barbaric appearance
  possessed by no other rugs. Sometimes they are confused with the
  Mosuls; but as a rule the pile is longer, and they are more
  coarsely woven. In fact, the yarn is so coarse that it is not
  unusual to see pieces with only thirty or forty knots to the
  square inch. Like the Persian-Kurdish rugs, they rarely come in
  large, almost square shapes, and are frequently decidedly oblong.
  They may, however, easily be distinguished from them by their
  cruder patterns, darker colours, coarser texture, and the fact
  that each of the two threads of warp encircled by a knot is
  equally prominent at the back.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally
  brown, red, and blue, with minor quantities of yellow, green, and
  white, and the natural colour of the undyed wool. <i>Knot</i>,
  Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally four to seven;
  perpendicularly, six to nine. A half knot, as it appears at back,
  is as long as, or longer than, wide. The rows of knots are
  closely pressed down. <i>Warp</i>, wool; each of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back.
  <i>Weft</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id=
  "Page_142">142</a></span> wool, of coarse diameter, and often
  dyed a reddish colour. A thread of weft crosses twice between
  every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, occasionally
  camel&rsquo;s or goat&rsquo;s hair clipped long. <i>Border</i>,
  generally of three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a heavy double
  overcasting, usually in brown or black, occasionally in several
  different colours. <i>Lower end</i>, a narrow web, through which
  runs a coloured cord, and warp loops. <i>Upper end</i>, a narrow
  web, one or more rows of knots and long, coarse warp fringe.
  <i>Texture</i>, very stout. <i>Weave</i> at back is of very
  coarse grain. <i>Length</i>, five to sixteen feet. <i>Width</i>,
  two fifths to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Persian
  Kurdistans.</span>&mdash;Nowhere is the influence of association
  among weavers more evident than in the Kurdish rugs woven by the
  tribes settled in the rich valleys of Northwestern Persia, as is
  apparent in weave, colours, and pattern, which differ widely from
  those seen in the Kurdish rugs of Asiatic Turkey. The warp is
  only rarely of coarse goats&rsquo; hair, and is generally soft,
  brown wool. The pile is much shorter, so that the drawing is
  clearly defined. Likewise, the colours are more varied and of
  more delicate tones so as to include lighter shades of green,
  rose, and ivory with the darker reds, blues, and browns. But the
  chief distinction consists of the more artistic pattern. The
  medallion in the centre of the field with corner pieces in which
  appear some form of repetitive pattern is most common. Instead of
  large figures are often the more dainty Herati designs borrowed
  from the Feraghans and the Sehnas, or the pear design from the
  Sarabends. Now and then is seen a rare old piece with field
  completely covered with drawings of the tree of life and strange
  floral conceits; but the pattern that is pre-eminently typical of
  this type of Kurdish pieces is the Mina Khani, though it is
  occasionally adopted in other rugs. The white and yellowish
  flowers, connected by a lattice work sub-pattern of brown or
  olive, rests on a ground of dark blue, that in accordance with a
  feature peculiar to rugs of Kurdish weaves varies from one end of
  the field to the other, so as to suggest that their wandering
  life often made it difficult to obtain the roots and herbs
  necessary to produce similar shades. As is rarely the case with
  other patterns, the naturalistic flowers that are pendent from
  the undulating vine of the main stripe and the flowers of the
  field have nearly the same drawing. The two remaining stripes of
  the narrow border have most simple vines.</p>

  <p>Almost without exception rugs of this class are stoutly
  woven.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id=
  "Page_143">143</a></span> To assure firmness, one thread of warp
  is depressed below the other in tying the knots; and the weft
  that is thrown across for filling is of fair quality. On account
  of the firm texture, excellent wool, and good colours it is still
  possible to obtain moderately old pieces, that as objects of
  utility as well as ornament are desirable for their sterling
  qualities.</p>

  <p>A similarity exists between the Persian-Kurdish, Mosul, and
  Bijar rugs; but a precise, even if easily overlooked, difference
  in the weave serves to distinguish one from the other. As may be
  seen by examining the backs of typical specimens, in Mosuls every
  thread of warp lies in the same plane parallel with the surface
  of the pile; in the Persian Kurdistans one of the two threads of
  warp encircled by a knot is depressed at an acute angle to that
  plane; and in Bijars one of the two threads of warp encircled by
  a knot is doubled under the other so as to be at right angles to
  that plane.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red
  and blue, also yellow, green, and white. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes.
  Knots to inch horizontally seven to ten; perpendicularly, eight
  to twelve. A half knot, as it appears at back, is no longer than
  wide and is frequently not so long. The yarn is loosely woven, so
  that each separate ply is distinct. The rows of knots are pressed
  down, so that the warp is largely concealed and the weft partly
  hidden at back. <i>Warp</i>, wool; one of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is generally much depressed below the other
  at back; but sometimes each is equally prominent. <i>Weft</i>,
  wool, of medium diameter. A thread of weft usually crosses twice
  between every two rows of knots, only rarely once. <i>Pile</i>,
  wool, and occasionally some camel&rsquo;s hair of medium length.
  <i>Border</i>, three to four stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a heavy
  double overcasting in dark colour. <i>Lower end</i>, web crossed
  by a parti-coloured cord, and warp loops. <i>Upper end</i>, web
  crossed by a parti-coloured cord, and loose warp fringe.
  <i>Texture</i>, very firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of coarse
  grain. <i>Usual length</i>, six to twelve feet. <i>Usual
  width</i>, five eighths to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Karajes.</span>&mdash;Dwelling
  near Hamadan, in the northwestern part of Persia, are tribes who
  weave rugs that are known in the markets as Karajes. In their
  colour scheme, length of nap, and texture they resemble many of
  the Kurdistans; but in the technicalities of weave they show a
  marked difference. As a rule, a single thread of weft crosses
  only once between two rows of knots, or in a few pieces
  two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id=
  "Page_144">144</a></span> threads of weft pass side by side as
  though one. In this particular they resemble Hamadans; but the
  alignment of their knots at the back is more regular, their weft
  is inserted with some slack, their warp is of wool, and their
  weft is almost always of wool. They are generally runners, with
  long nap of soft, lustrous wool, with rich colours, and with
  border of three stripes. The pattern is Iranian, and very often
  consists of a small bush or sprig of leaf and flower disposed in
  formal array throughout the field. Sometimes the floral forms are
  placed within the diamonds formed by a trellis pattern, but more
  frequently they are arranged in rows like the pear designs of
  Sarabends. In some pieces they are very much conventionalised and
  suggest similar figures seen in rugs of Southern Caucasia; and in
  others stem, leaf, and flower are very realistic. Another pattern
  frequently followed consists of three or four large
  diamond-shaped medallions extending from one end of the field to
  the other. The borders are moderately narrow, and an undulating
  vine of well-known Persian character generally appears in one or
  more of the stripes. As these pieces are almost always
  comparatively old, the vegetable dyes that were used for
  colouring have mellowed, and have a richness of tone that is
  accentuated by the depth of pile and softness of wool. The
  prevailing tone of many is a deep plum colour.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dark
  blue or plum and red, with minor quantities of yellow, brown, and
  white. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally six to
  twelve; perpendicularly, seven to twelve. A half knot, as it
  appears at back, is as long as wide, and occasionally is longer.
  The rows of knots, which have even alignment at back, are not
  firmly pressed down. <i>Warp</i>, wool, rarely cotton; each of
  the two threads encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back.
  <i>Weft</i>, wool, rarely cotton; a single thread of medium
  diameter crosses once between every two rows of knots; but in
  parts of the same rug two, three, or even four threads of small
  diameter will cross side by side as a single coarse thread.
  Occasionally a thread of weft crosses three or four times. The
  filling of weft stands up as high as the knots at the back,
  giving an even surface. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium length or
  moderately long. <i>Border</i>, of three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a
  heavy double overcasting. <i>Lower end</i>, web and warp loops.
  <i>Upper end</i>, web and short fringe. <i>Texture</i>,
  moderately loose. <i>Weave</i> at back is of coarse grain.
  <i>Usual length</i>, eight to fourteen feet. <i>Usual width</i>,
  three eighths to one half length.</p>

  Tabriz, capital of the province of Azerbijan, is situated in a
  remote corner of Persia, from the earliest times it has been one
  of the most important centres in the Orient for the production of
  carpets. They were well known in the days of the Caliphs; and
  some of the earliest masterpieces that now remain were woven
  there during the reign of Shah Tamasp, who extended to this
  industry his royal patronage. This city has been for a long
  period on the great routes of caravans passing to Trebizond and
  Tiflis from the country to the south and east, so that it has
  become the principal mart of Persia for the export of rugs
  gathered from surrounding regions. Nevertheless, it still
  continues to produce its own pieces; but the weavers are in the
  employ of foreign companies who prescribe the character of
  workmanship. As a consequence, the rugs are of good material,
  excellently woven; and though many of the old dyes are no longer
  used, the colours as a rule are fair; yet on account of the
  mathematical exactness of their formal patterns the truly
  Oriental spirit is largely lacking.</p>

  <p>Since the rugs are made solely to meet the requirements of
  Western buyers, the patterns are various. Most of them consist of
  a large central medallion surrounded by a broad field of ivory,
  blue, or red that extends to the sides and ends. In others, a
  small diamond occupies the centre and is surrounded by a series
  of concentric medallions. Although in these respects they
  correspond with Kermanshahs, Sarouks, and Kashans, the patterns
  of their fields lack the long scrolls and interlacing branches,
  and consist frequently of short, slender stems supporting fronds,
  leaves, flowers, or the pear designs arranged so as to present
  almost the appearance of lace-work. Sometimes the drawing is a
  delicate tracery representing intertwining arabesques. A field
  completely covered with the small designs peculiar to Sehnas, or
  containing the disjunct forms of nomadic rugs, is never seen; and
  yet it is not improbable that many of the early Tabriz weavers
  were Kurds. Sometimes the flowers are similar to the roses of
  Kirmans, or are realistically drawn composit&aelig; surrounded by
  delicate leaves on graceful stems; some times the small designs
  are as formal as the palmettes of old Ispahans, from which they
  were doubtless copied; again, the naturalistic and conventional
  may be blended together in an harmonious whole. But whatever the
  pattern, the different parts show the perfect balance so
  frequently seen in the antique pieces of three or four centuries
  ago. Nevertheless, to these types are many excep<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>tions,
  since the weavers will produce for hire any class of rug or copy
  any coloured drawing.</p>

  <p>The borders differ from those of Kermanshahs, with which these
  rugs are frequently compared, in the fact that in their central
  stripe the continuous vine of leaf and flower is less
  conspicuous; and in its place are often palmettes, pears, shrubs,
  or formal trees separated by foliated scrolls. Not infrequently
  the smaller stripes, also, have a repetitive pattern of leaf and
  flower, though in some of the many stripes is usually a
  well-drawn vine. Again, the border may consist of a series of
  cartouches that have been copied from much older rugs and contain
  verses of the Koran or of Persian poets. Within recent years this
  tendency among the Tabriz and Kermanshah weavers to imitate not
  only borders but also fields of old masterpieces is
  increasing.</p>

  <p>A feature peculiar to a very large number of these rugs is the
  adoption of very finely spun linen for the warp; though cotton,
  which is used for the weft, is sometimes substituted. The knots
  are carefully tied, and the closely woven texture presents an
  appearance at the back similar to that of Sarouks; but the almost
  concealed weft is generally either white or pink. The weave
  compared with that of Kermanshahs is finer, but the wool of the
  closely shorn nap is neither so soft to the touch nor so silky,
  the colours are harsher, and the patterns more formal. These rugs
  are made in all sizes, though most are large and almost
  square.</p>

  <p><i>Type characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  blue, and ivory. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch
  horizontally twelve to twenty; perpendicularly, ten to
  twenty-two. The rows of knots are pressed down, so that the warp
  is hidden and the weft partly concealed at back. <i>Warp</i>,
  generally cotton, frequently linen; one of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is doubled under the other. <i>Weft</i>, as a
  rule, is cotton, occasionally it is wool or linen, of fine
  diameter, and frequently dyed pink. A thread of weft crosses
  twice between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, clipped
  short and harsh to the touch. <i>Border</i>, from five to eight
  stripes and an outer edging. <i>Sides</i>, a two-cord selvage.
  <i>Both ends</i>, a narrow web and loose warp fringe.
  <i>Texture</i>, firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of fine texture.
  <i>Usual length</i>, nine to eighteen feet. <i>Usual width</i>,
  two thirds to four fifths length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Gorevans.</span>&mdash;Of the
  many rugs now made in Persia and designed primarily for use, few
  are of such moderate price as the Gorevans,<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span> which,
  during recent years, have been imported in large numbers from the
  province of Azerbijan in Northwestern Persia. A hasty glance
  suggests Occidental craftsmanship, but in every essential they
  are distinctly Oriental. Their stout weave, large size, and
  nearly square shape place them in the class of Persian pieces
  often called carpets, to which belong the Kermanshahs, Muskabads,
  Mesheds, and rugs of Tabriz. Yet they are frequently larger than
  any of these, and are readily distinguished from them by their
  colours and patterns. It is true that they have the same light
  shades, but the tones are in a distinctly different scale,
  consisting principally of dull brick-red, light terra cotta,
  buff, dark blue, dull green, yellow, and ivory, which, when once
  recognised, are rarely mistaken for those of any other rugs. Nor
  are the colours distributed in patches so small as to blend when
  viewed at a short distance, but are of sufficient masses to be
  separately observed and analysed.</p>

  <p>The patterns are equally distinctive. The field is generally
  covered with a number of concentric hexagonal-shaped medallions,
  of which the longer sides of the largest are often marked with
  conspicuous indentations such as are not seen in classes made in
  other districts. All of the medallions are covered with large
  designs, in which the artist has departed from the usual forms of
  vine, leaf, and flower, that poorly imitate the splendid examples
  of so-called &ldquo;Ispahans,&rdquo; and in many instances has
  represented them in the archaic drawing of the oldest remaining
  Persian carpets. Hard, straight lines with angles replacing
  graceful curves define the medallions, corners, stems, leaves,
  and flowers. And not infrequently the formal treatment shows a
  European influence, as when all semblance of leaf and flower has
  disappeared in the extremely conventionalised forms that are
  placed with set regularity in the field. A very noticeable
  feature of these rugs is the manner in which the designs are
  coloured, as it is not unusual to represent a large figure in two
  strongly contrasting colours, as blue and pink separated by a
  stiffly drawn line.</p>

  <p>The designs of the corners are similar to those of the central
  medallions, but the designs of the borders are dissimilar. The
  small stripes are marked with Persian vines of well-known floral
  and leaf forms that show nothing of the drawing characteristic of
  the field. The main stripe occasionally has cartouches and star
  medallions, but in most instances has the turtle pattern, though
  its treatment differs from the usual form seen in Feraghans.
  A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id=
  "Page_148">148</a></span> co-ordination in colour exists between
  field and border. The ground of both the main stripe and one of
  the medallions is often a dark blue or a red, while the ground of
  the other stripes corresponds with those of other medallions.</p>

  <p>All of the Gorevans are modern pieces, and so lack the
  interest of those that follow traditional patterns; but their
  stout weave, warm colours, and archaic designs make them both
  serviceable and pleasing.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dull
  red, dark blue, and buff, with minor quantities of green, yellow,
  and white. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally six
  to eight; perpendicularly, six to ten. The most conspicuous half
  of a knot, as it appears at the back, is, as a rule, longer than
  wide. The rows of knots are somewhat pressed down, but the warp
  is rarely entirely concealed at back. <i>Warp</i>, cotton; one of
  the two threads encircled by a knot is usually depressed below
  the other at back; sometimes both threads are equally prominent.
  <i>Weft</i>, cotton, of coarse diameter, sometimes dyed blue. A
  thread of weft crosses only once between every two rows of knots,
  or frequently twice. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium length.
  <i>Border</i>, generally of three stripes, occasionally four or
  five. <i>Sides</i>, a two-cord double selvage. <i>Both ends</i>,
  a short warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, rather loose. <i>Weave</i>
  at back is of very coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, ten to
  sixteen feet. <i>Usual width</i>, three fifths to three quarters
  length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Bakshis.</span>&mdash;A close
  relationship exists between the Gorevans, which are a
  comparatively modern product, and several other less known
  sub-classes of earlier origin that are woven in small towns in
  the east central part of the province of Azerbijan. One of these
  towns, located fifty miles to the southeast of Tabriz, is
  Bakshis, which formerly produced rugs that were highly esteemed
  by the Persians, before the weavers were corrupted by a spirit of
  commercialism. Those which are exported to-day are of little
  artistic value, are poorly coloured, and carelessly woven. The
  patterns are inferior copies of other well-known classes.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Serapis.</span>&mdash;The rugs
  known as Serapis are named after the village of Sirab in the
  mountainous district between Tabriz and Ardebil; but they are
  made not only there, but also in the country farther to the east.
  The large sizes are frequently mistaken for Gorevans, as
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id=
  "Page_149">149</a></span>they are of similar shape and have
  similar finish of sides and ends, yet as a rule they are better
  woven. Many of them follow the same patterns of concentric
  medallions, but the lines of others are more artistically drawn.
  Although the borders lack the gracefully symmetric vines of old
  Iranian pieces, the drawing is interesting in its individuality
  and is in harmony with that of the field. All the colours are
  cheerful. A field of ivory or some light shade of buff usually
  surrounds the central medallions, on which appear soft and
  pleasing tones of smaller designs. Yet on the whole there is a
  tendency to employ richer and deeper tones than those of
  Gorevans. The smaller pieces often contain more elaborate
  patterns, but there are always the same pleasing and unobtrusive
  shades of colour.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  blue, and ivory, with minor quantities of green and yellow.
  <i>Knot</i>, generally Sehna, frequently Ghiordes. Knots to inch
  horizontally six to ten; perpendicularly, seven to twelve. The
  rows of knots are firmly pressed down, so that the warp does not
  show at back. <i>Warp</i>, cotton; one of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is generally much depressed below the other
  at back, and frequently doubled under the other. <i>Weft</i>,
  cotton, of coarse diameter. A thread of weft crosses twice
  between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool of medium
  length. <i>Border</i>, three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a double
  selvage of two cords, or double overcasting attached figure-eight
  fashion to the sides. The selvage or overcasting is usually in
  red or buff. <i>Lower end</i>, a narrow web and warp loops or
  short warp fringe. <i>Upper end</i>, a narrow web and warp
  fringe. <i>Texture</i>, stout. <i>Weave</i> at back is of coarse
  grain. <i>Usual length</i>, ten to eighteen feet. <i>Usual
  width</i>, two thirds to three quarters length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Herez.</span>&mdash;The city of
  Herez is in the extreme eastern part of the province of
  Azerbijan, where for a long time the weavers steadily adhered to
  the sterling values of early fabrics and produced pieces that
  were followed with slight modification in many of the former
  Gorevans. In a measure the rugs of Tabriz also are reflected in
  the medallion pattern of some of these pieces, but for their
  gracefully flowing lines are substituted more rectangular ones;
  and in place of many colours are few, of which blue and a reddish
  copper are particularly noticeable. Another well-known and
  interesting type consists of a field of white, on which, with
  formal precision, are represented, in delicate shades of red,
  blue, yellow, and green,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150"
  id="Page_150">150</a></span> archaic leaves and flowers supported
  by stems and tendrils that are so conventionalised as to form
  geometric lines and angles. At regular intervals the branching
  tendrils assume the shape of arches, of which in larger pieces
  there are frequently one or two dozen; and so closely do they
  resemble prayer arches that these rugs are sometimes mistaken for
  namazliks. The borders usually consist of three stripes. The
  outer and inner are narrow guards containing some simple floral
  figure, and the broad central stripe has often a continuous vine
  with formal leaves and a conspicuous design suggestive of the
  cloud-band. The tones are never harsh; many of the pieces are
  large and almost square, and the wool of the pile is generally
  excellent.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally
  ivory, light blue, and reddish brown, also some yellow and green.
  <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally five to ten;
  perpendicularly, six to twelve. The most conspicuous half of a
  knot, as it appears at the back, is longer than wide. The rows of
  knots are only slightly pressed down, so that the weft is
  noticeable at back. <i>Warp</i>, cotton; one of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is depressed below the other at back, or each
  thread is equally prominent. <i>Weft</i>, of cotton, seldom of
  wool, of moderately coarse diameter. A thread of weft crosses
  twice between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool of
  medium length. <i>Border</i>, generally of three stripes.
  <i>Sides</i>, a two-cord double selvage. <i>Lower end</i>, a very
  narrow web and short warp fringe. <i>Upper end</i>, a short warp
  fringe. <i>Texture</i>, loose. <i>Weave</i> at back is of very
  coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, nine to fifteen feet. <i>Usual
  width</i>, two thirds to seven eighths length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Suj-Bulaks.</span>&mdash;About
  fifty miles to the south of Lake Urumiah and the same distance
  from the western boundary of Persia is the old Kurdish capital of
  Suj-Bulak. Kurds still largely predominate in the district and
  comprise most of the population of the city, to the discomfort of
  the much smaller number of Persians, for whose protection a large
  garrison was formerly maintained. Accordingly, the rugs made in
  this vicinity are strongly characteristic of Kurdish pieces in
  the strong texture, the excellent quality of wool, the rich, dark
  colours, the finish of sides and ends. The patterns also are
  largely Kurdish, but frequently show the influence of Persian
  association.</p>

  <p>In typical old pieces deep reds and blues are largely used.
  One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id=
  "Page_151">151</a></span> of them is generally the ground colour
  of the central field, and shows the Kurdish influence by a
  gradual shading from end to end; the other appears in the
  overlying pattern, which partakes of a floral character. The
  drawing sometimes represents flowering plants, such as the rose
  bush, arranged in perpendicular rows and brightened by tints of
  white, green, or yellow. Detached flowers not infrequently line
  the edges of the field. The wide borders also, as a rule, have
  vines and floral forms.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dark
  red and blue, with minor quantities of brown, green, yellow, and
  ivory. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally seven to
  ten; perpendicularly, eight to twelve. The rows of knots are, as
  a rule, pressed down, so that the alignment of each half knot is
  very uneven; but frequently this feature is not regularly
  maintained in all parts of the same rug, so that here and there
  the warp is noticeable at back. <i>Warp</i>, wool; each of the
  two threads encircled by a knot is generally equally prominent at
  back, but occasionally one is depressed below the other.
  <i>Weft</i>, wool, of medium diameter. A thread of weft crosses
  twice between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool of
  medium length. <i>Border</i>, of three to four stripes.
  <i>Sides</i>, a double selvage of two or three cords in blue,
  red, or brown. <i>Lower end</i>, a web through which runs a
  parti-coloured cord, and a warp fringe. Frequently there is a
  braided selvage in addition to the web. <i>Upper end</i>, the
  same as lower, excepting that the web is occasionally turned back
  and hemmed. <i>Texture</i>, moderately loose. <i>Weave</i> at
  back is of slightly coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, six to
  seven feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two fifths to three fifths
  length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Karadaghs.</span>&mdash;In the
  extreme northwestern part of Persia, between the city of Tabriz
  and the river Aras, is a mountain range called Kara Dagh, which
  signifies the &ldquo;Black Mountain,&rdquo; On its slopes and in
  the adjoining valleys rugs have been woven for at least several
  hundred years, and at one time were well known in Europe, but few
  have reached this country. Most of them are produced for home
  use, so that they are, as a rule, well woven, of good material,
  and of vegetable dyes. They resemble in colour scheme, weave, and
  finish of sides and ends the rugs of Karabagh, which immediately
  adjoins this district on the north. Indeed, in no other rugs of
  Persia are the traditions of Iranian weavers so much disregarded
  and Caucasian ideas so closely followed.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id=
  "Page_152">152</a></span>The field of many of these rugs is
  completely covered with conventionalised flowers of several
  different colours, so arranged that diagonal lines are of similar
  colours. Sometimes it is covered with a pattern of
  hexagonal-shaped figures containing geometric forms or
  conventionalised floral designs. Again, it may contain the Herati
  pattern or one similar to the Mina-Khani. In fact, some
  repetitive pattern of small design is the usual type; but now and
  then some form of pole medallion, which the weavers have learned
  from their more southern neighbours, is substituted. The patterns
  of the borders are either mechanically drawn vines or contain
  geometric figures characteristic of Caucasian pieces. For guard
  stripes the reciprocal trefoil is constantly used.</p>

  <p>The colour scheme is generally bright and pleasing. A
  favourite colour for the field is blue or a camel&rsquo;s hair
  yellow; sometimes rose is seen. The nap of modern pieces is
  medium long and of old pieces is short. The weave of the latter
  is excellent, so that the closely pressed knots and stout threads
  of weft make at the back an even surface unlike the coarse
  appearance of many rugs.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally blue,
  red, yellow, green, and white. Knot, Ghiordes. <i>Knots</i> to
  inch horizontally seven to eleven; perpendicularly, seven to
  eleven. The rows of knots are not firmly pressed down, so that
  the warp appears at back, and the weft is prominent. <i>Warp</i>,
  wool; each of the threads encircled by a knot is equally distinct
  at back. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of coarse diameter, occasionally
  dyed. A thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows of
  knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of moderate length. <i>Border</i>,
  three to six stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a double selvage of two or
  three cords. <i>Both ends</i>, a narrow web and short warp
  fringe. <i>Texture</i>, moderately firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is
  of rather coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, five to nine feet.
  <i>Usual width</i>, two fifths to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Mosuls.</span>&mdash;Near the
  ruins of ancient Nineveh, on the bank of the Tigris, is the city
  of Mosul. Once it was not only an important mart for wares
  carried up and down the river, and for vast caravans from east
  and west, but it became noted for its textiles from which was
  derived the name &ldquo;muslin.&rdquo; At length on account of
  pestilence, misrule, and the sack of armies its population and
  industries have dwindled; though it is still the capital and
  commercial centre of a district that lies between the high
  table-lands surrounding Lake Van and the low plains of Bagdad,
  and that extends across the Mesopotamian<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span> valley
  to the mountain ridges bordering Western Persia. Within this
  extensive area are large stretches of rich pasture, where Abraham
  once fed his flocks, and where each year Kurdish nomads from the
  north drive their sheep when the winter snows cover their own
  hillsides. Arabs, Turks, Armenians, Jews, and Christians likewise
  mingle with the natives, so that the population is as mixed as
  can be found anywhere in the Orient.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

    title="" />

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 35. Konieh Prayer
    Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>Thus it happens that the rugs marketed in the city of Mosul
  are made by different races and show great diversity of
  character. It would, indeed, be often difficult to distinguish
  them if the weave were disregarded; for though they are prone to
  yellow and russet hues, and the long wool is floccy as well as
  lustrous, there is no pattern that can be considered truly
  typical. Many of them borrow Caucasian designs, such as stars,
  latch-hooks, diagonal bands, and barber-pole stripes. Others have
  patterns adopted almost bodily from Kurdish pieces. But however
  much the nomadic rugs are copied, a Persian influence is always
  shown by the way in which the severer features are softened. In
  fact, a very large percentage of rugs that come from Mosul are
  made by the tribes that wander as far east as the great mountain
  divides along the borders of Western Persia, and adopt patterns
  and colour schemes current in Azerbijan and Ardelan. It
  accordingly happens that medallion patterns resembling those of
  Bijars, but with bolder and less graceful outlines, are seen.
  More frequently the field is covered with small figures common to
  Feraghans, as well as with the well-known pear designs; but the
  former are coarsely drawn, and the latter lack the gracefully
  rounded lines seen in Sarabends and are often as geometric as
  those of the Baku rugs. Somewhere in almost all these pieces
  appears evidence of some conventionalised floral form; but now
  and then a rare old piece is found which was woven in the plains
  of Mesopotamia, with field completely covered with a
  naturalistically drawn tulip that grows on the banks of the
  Tigris and Euphrates. Its bright flowers and leaves, supported by
  a delicate stalk, constitute one of the most beautiful designs
  seen in any rug.</p>

  <p>The borders are rarely wide, and generally consist of three
  stripes, one of which usually has some simple vine, and the
  others some well-known geometric pattern. It is, also, not
  unusual to find an outer edging surrounding the border. In a few
  of these pieces camel&rsquo;s hair is used even to the extent of
  occupying the whole field; and goat&rsquo;s<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span> hair or
  sheep&rsquo;s wool, dyed to a similar colour, is constantly
  employed. One of the most usual colours is some shade of yellow.
  Reddish hues also prevail. These rugs frequently have the same
  pleasing effect of slightly graduated changes so common in the
  ground colour of Kurdistans, but as a whole the colour scheme is
  lighter. On the other hand, they follow the shading adopted in
  Persian rugs, which in a measure eliminates the sudden transition
  between adjacent areas of strongly contrasting colour so
  noticeable in nomadic pieces. On account of the present
  remoteness of the Mosul district from important highways of
  travel, many excellent pieces, which with careful use should
  acquire the rich tones of those now old, are still woven
  there.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally
  yellow and brownish red, with minor quantities of blue, green,
  and white. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally five
  to seven; perpendicularly, seven to nine. A half knot, as it
  appears at back, is as long as wide and frequently longer. The
  yarn is not drawn tightly against the warp. The rows of knots are
  firmly pressed down, so that the warp is concealed at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, almost always wool, rarely cotton; each of the two
  threads encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back.
  <i>Weft</i>, generally of wool, of coarse diameter and frequently
  dyed red or orange, but occasionally of cotton. As a rule, a
  thread of weft crosses twice between two rows of knots, but
  sometimes crosses only once; or two or three threads cross side
  by side, as in Karajes. <i>Pile</i>, wool and occasionally
  camel&rsquo;s hair, of medium length. <i>Border</i>, of three
  stripes with frequently an outer edging of solid colour.
  <i>Sides</i> are generally a heavy double overcasting, but in a
  few pieces there is a two-cord weft selvage or double selvage.
  <i>Lower end</i>, a web. <i>Upper end</i>, a web and warp fringe;
  occasionally there is a heavy braided selvage, or the web is
  turned back and hemmed. <i>Texture</i>, moderately firm.
  <i>Weave</i> at back is of coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, six
  to ten feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two fifths to three quarters
  length.</p>

  <p class="tb">Now and then are seen comparatively scarce rugs,
  such as the Teheran, Gulistan, Kara-Geuz, Bibikabad, Afshar, and
  Gozene, that were woven within the Iranian boundaries. Some of
  them are no longer produced, and others are woven in such small
  numbers that but few are exported.</p>

  floral <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id=

  is two or three times as long as wide. The weave resembles that

  warp and weft are cotton. The borders are wide, and the sides are
  finished with a two-cord selvage.</p>

  <p>Gulistan is the Persian name for a flower garden, and the rugs
  known by that name were once made in a district not far from
  Kashan, where rose bushes bloomed profusely. The fields may be
  covered with conventionalised floral and leaf patterns, or again
  they may contain roses naturalistically drawn with extended
  petals, as if viewed from above. The most striking characteristic
  is the opulence of colour, such as red, blue, and yellow softened
  by shades of brown and green. Even the weft and the webs of the
  ends are red, blue, or brown. The sides have a two-cord selvage,
  warp and weft are usually of cotton, and one thread of warp to
  each knot is depressed at the back. These rugs, which formerly
  came in large sizes, are no longer made.</p>

  <p>Only a short distance to the northeast of Hamadan is the
  district of Kara-Geuz, which is occupied by a large tribe, who in
  the past have furnished some of the best of Persian cavalry. The
  people are industrious, and not only cultivate the land but
  engage in weaving. Some of their rugs closely resemble the
  Kurdish pieces, and others correspond with the Irans. In the
  technique of weave they often follow the Hamadans. On the
  outskirts of this district is the town of Bibikabad, where, also,
  rugs are woven for market.</p>

  <p>For a number of generations the country adjoining Lake Urumiah
  on the west and stretching into the Turkish domain has been
  partly occupied by a powerful race of brave and active people who
  are known as Afshars. They are regarded as a branch of the Yuruks
  of Asia Minor, and the rugs of both tribes have many points of
  similarity. The wool of the nap is generally the coarse product
  of the mountain sheep. The patterns incorporate some of the
  floral features of Persian rugs, though they display many
  Caucasian characteristics. These Afshars bear a close resemblance
  to the Kazaks, from which they may be distinguished by observing
  a fold as they are bent backwards, which will show the fibres of
  the yarn of a knot standing out at front as a unit, while in
  Kazaks they have a greater tendency to blend. Also at the back,
  each half of a knot is no longer than wide, nor is it drawn
  closely against the warp, while in Kazaks each half of a knot is
  often double its width and is drawn closer.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id=
  "Page_156">156</a></span>In the country about Gozene, in the
  watershed of the Euphrates river, are made a few rugs for local
  use, though they occasionally reach Western markets. The pattern,
  which is very simple, usually consists of some small diaper
  figure of brown or grey colour, or of dull tones of maroon. Many
  of this class have a double foundation of warp; and frequently,
  at the back, the knots do not form regular lines parallel with
  the length, as is the case with other rugs. This is due to the
  fact that any thread of warp may be encircled by both the left
  half of some knots and the right half of others. Occasionally,
  also, a knot is tied about four threads of warp. In other rugs of
  this class which have a single foundation of warp the weave
  resembles that of Mosuls.</p>

  <h4>BORDER STRIPES</h4>

  <p>The most noticeable feature of Persian border stripes is their
  floral character, which is very frequently represented by a vine
  winding from side to side with pendent flowers marking each
  flexure. Some of these vines have been evolved from arabesques,
  and others from naturalistic tendrils, but all are graceful. In a
  few pieces the stripes contain rows of detached flowers,
  rosettes, or pears, expressed in rich yet unobtrusive colours,
  that are always in perfect harmony with those of the field.
  Rarely is the pattern geometric. Accordingly, with the exception
  of the Indian and some of the Chinese, they are the most elegant,
  pleasing, and artistic of all border stripes. Moreover, some of
  them follow almost the same patterns that were in use centuries
  ago.</p>

  <p class="tb"><i>Primary Stripes.</i>&mdash;In Plate <a href=
  "#pe">E</a>, Fig. 1 (opp. Page 156), is represented a typical
  Herat stripe derived from some of the XV and XVI Century carpets.
  It shows close relationship to the pattern of conventional
  rosette and pair of attendant leaves so frequently seen on the
  fields of such rugs as the Feraghans and Sehnas. In this stripe
  the angular and serrated leaves are extended to form a vine.</p>

  <p>One of the best known Khorassan stripes, shown in Plate
  <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 2, bears a resemblance to the Herat
  stripe; and it is not unlikely that they had a common origin,
  since they were designed in adjoining and freely communicating
  districts. The enlargements of the vine at the centre of each
  flexure are doubtless leaves, but they occasionally resemble the
  heads of birds.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id=
  "Page_157">157</a></span></p>

  <p>The so-called turtle pattern, Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig.
  3, has probably been derived from the interlacing arabesques that
  appeared in rugs at least as early as the beginning of the XV
  Century, as is indicated on Page 79. The rosette and attendant
  leaves between adjacent &ldquo;turtles&rdquo; suggest the Herati
  pattern. This stripe is found principally in Feraghans, Irans,
  Sehnas, and Muskabads. One that is similar, but more mechanically
  drawn and with wider spreading arms, is typical of Gorevans and
  Serapis.</p>

  <p>A stripe found in Joshaghans, representing a row of floral
  bushes, is shown in Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 4. It is also
  seen in some of the old rugs of Northwestern Persia. Another
  Joshaghan stripe, which also suggests the Herati pattern, is
  represented in Fig. 5.</p>

  <p>A single row of pears (Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 6) is a
  characteristic Luristan stripe.</p>

  <p>The dainty pattern of Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 7, in
  which the vine has been abandoned and serrated leaves nearly
  surround a floral device, shows a not unusual Herez stripe.</p>

  <p>As a rule the drawing of Persian-Kurdish stripes is never
  crowded, and represents a simple vine with bright pendent
  flowers. A stripe commonly seen in this class is represented in
  Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 8. It is also seen in the
  Bijars.</p>

  <p>On account of the geographic position of the Karadagh
  district, which is separated only by the Aras river from
  Caucasia, its stripes show a combination of floral and geometric
  design not usual in other Persian pieces. Plate <a href=
  "#pe">E</a>, Fig. 9, represents one of these stripes with a
  rosette, and the serrated leaf so common among the Shirvans.
  Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 10, represents another stripe of
  the same class with eight-petalled star-shaped flowers pendent
  from an angular vine.</p>

  <p>A beautiful stripe, representing a vine and pendant flower,
  which is frequently seen in some of the Persian-Kurdish rugs, is
  shown in Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 11.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 12, is illustrated a very
  dainty pattern of vine and roses that now and then is seen in old
  Feraghans; and in Fig. 13 are also represented vine and roses as
  they occasionally appear in old rugs of Northwestern Persia.</p>

  <p>The very mechanically drawn double vine shown in Plate
  <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 14, is sometimes seen in stripes of
  Hamadans. In fact, simplicity of border is a characteristic of
  this class.</p>

  <p>Mosul and Kurdish stripes show a similarity, but the former
  are often more mechanically drawn than the latter. In Plate
  <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 15,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span> is a stripe from an old
  and beautiful Mosul with conventionalised vine and King
  Solomon&rsquo;s eight-pointed star.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly the most typical of any class of Persian stripes
  is the well-known Sarabend pattern of formal vine with pendent
  pear on white ground. It is very rarely that a rug of this class
  is without this stripe (Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 16). Its
  presence at once indicates that the piece is either a Sarabend or
  an Iran copy.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 17, is the well-known pear
  pattern of a Meshed stripe. The graceful form, resembling in a
  measure the Indian drawing, is peculiar to these stripes.</p>

  <p>The Kirman stripe (Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 18)
  invariably contains red roses naturalistically drawn, surrounded
  by a profusion of leaves and stems. This is one of the most
  beautiful of Persian border patterns.</p>

  <p>Somewhat similar, but far more formal, is the Kermanshah
  stripe, one of which appears in Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig.
  19, with mechanically drawn flowers, leaves, and vines.</p>

  <p>The formal pattern (Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 20) of
  octagons surrounded by latch-hooks is now and then found in
  borders of Shiraz rugs, and indicates how great a concession
  their weavers at times make to nomadic influences.</p>

  <p>The main stripe of Sehnas is always narrow and contains some
  floral form, though frequently much conventionalised. One of
  these stripes is shown in Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig. 21.</p>

  <p>Very few Persian rugs have such wealth of floral ornamentation
  in the borders as the Sarouks and Kashans. A stripe typical of
  the former is represented in Plate <a href="#pe">E</a>, Fig.
  22.</p>

  <p class="tb"><i>Secondary and Tertiary Stripes.</i>&mdash;The
  ornamentation of a large proportion of secondary stripes of
  Persian rugs consists of running vines, which fall within two
  divisions, according to the absence or presence of pendants.</p>

  <p>Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 1 (opp. Page 158), taken from
  an inner stripe of a Kermanshah, shows one of the simplest vines
  with budding tendrils at each flexure.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 2, is a simple stripe seen
  in such rugs as Gorevans. Similar stripes are very common. As
  there is no pendant, the character of the vine depends upon the
  form it assumes in alternating flexures, one of which in this
  instance is an eight-petalled star.</p>

  <p>In many of the Karadaghs is seen the Caucasian stripe (Plate
  <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 3) consisting of an angular vine, from
  each flexure of which spring small designs like three-leaf
  clover.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate F. Secondary
  Border-Stripes of Persian Rugs</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate F. Secondary
  Border-Stripes of Persian Rugs</span></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id=
  "Page_159">159</a></span></p>

  <p>Another type peculiar to some rugs of Northwestern Persia, as
  the Bijars and even Sehnas, is shown in Plate <a href=
  "#pf">F</a>, Fig. 4. Here one flexure is a serrated leaf, and the
  other is a small rosette with short curving tendrils.</p>

  <p>A simple vine of somewhat similar order appears in Plate
  <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 5. At each flexure is a flower of four
  petals, and from alternating flexures spring tendrils of colour
  different from that of the vine. Stripes of similar drawing
  appeared in Persian carpets as early as 1350 <span class=
  "smcap">a. d.</span> A further stage in the development of the
  same pattern is illustrated in Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig.
  6.</p>

  <p>One of the simplest forms of a vine with pendant is shown in
  <a href="#pf">Plate F</a>, Fig. 7. It appears in Asia Minor
  carpets woven during the XIII Century, and also in some of the
  earliest Iranian carpets. Now and then it is seen in modern
  Persian rugs.</p>

  <p>A very common form of a vine with pendant is shown in <a href=
  "#pf">Plate F</a>, Fig. 8. This pattern is seen in a large number
  of Persian rugs, such as Mosuls, Bijars, Kurdistans, and
  Hamadans. Each flexure of the vine is enlarged to almost the form
  of a leaf, and between them is a branching pendant.</p>

  <p>In another stripe (Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 9), taken
  from a Feraghan, there is no particular enlargement to the vine,
  and the alternating pendants are buds and flowers of four
  petals.</p>

  <p>A more geometric form that appears in such rugs as Muskabads
  is shown in Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 10. In this the vine
  represents serrated leaves, and suggests one of the Shirvan
  patterns.</p>

  <p>A very similar stripe (Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 11),
  taken from a Sehna, should be compared with those of Figs. 8 and
  10, as it serves to illustrate the evolution of vine patterns. In
  fact, if a very large number of stripes were arranged in proper
  order, they would show almost imperceptible gradations from one
  type to another.</p>

  <p>One of the simplest vines with pendant, adopted by the Kurdish
  tribes, is shown in Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 12; and in
  Fig. 13 is another vine with pendent pear alternating with a
  rosette.</p>

  <p>Not all the patterns, however, are vines. In Plate <a href=
  "#pf">F</a>, Figs. 14 and 15, for instance, is represented the
  same secondary stripe as it appears at the sides and the ends of
  some moderately old Persian rugs. The former pattern bears a
  resemblance to the one in Fig. 5, and each illustrates a series
  of connecting links.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id=
  "Page_160">160</a></span>A graceful pattern that is seen in
  Bijars, Hamadans, and other rugs of Northwestern Persia is
  represented in Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 16. It was
  probably derived from an old form of leaf and tendril.</p>

  <p>The reciprocal trefoil (Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 17)
  which is constantly used in a tertiary stripe, is probably a
  degenerate form of an ornate floral design. It is more widely
  used for a border stripe than any other pattern, as it is found
  not only in such Persian rugs as Sarabends, Bijars, Sarouks, and
  Kashans, but in many of the Indian and Beluchistan rugs, and in
  almost all of the Caucasian group. It was commonly used in
  Persian rugs as early as the year 1500.</p>

  <p>In many of the rugs of Persia and Asia Minor is seen as a
  tertiary stripe the simple ribbon pattern (Plate <a href=
  "#pf">F</a>, Fig. 18). Its origin is lost in the dim past, and it
  is not improbable that once it had a symbolic meaning.</p>

  <p>A very interesting tertiary stripe, because of its
  well-authenticated age, contains the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; pattern
  shown in Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 19. It is found in some
  Persian carpets that were woven as early as 1550.</p>

  <p>One of the simplest guard stripes, shown in Plate <a href=
  "#pf">F</a>, Fig. 20, is frequently found in modern Persian rugs,
  as well as in Iranian carpets woven six centuries ago.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

  <h4>ASIA MINOR RUGS</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/a.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="A"
  title="A" /></span>LL rugs that are woven in the Turkish
  provinces of Asia are frequently grouped together and called
  &ldquo;Turkish&rdquo; rugs; but a more natural classification is
  to distinguish between those made to the east and those made to
  the west of a line drawn from the Gulf of Iskenderoon to
  Trebizond, deflecting slightly in its course so as to follow the
  ridges that divide the watershed of the western forks of the
  Euphrates river from the plateau of Anatolia. With the exception
  of the very few pieces that come from Syria or other southerly
  districts, those woven in the Turkish provinces east of this line
  show such a relationship to those of Persia that they are more
  properly classed with them; while on the other hand, with the
  exception of the rugs of the wandering Yuruks, those woven to the
  west of this line and in the neighbouring islands of the
  Mediterranean conform so closely to a common type that they fall
  naturally into a separate group. It is better, therefore, to
  treat them separately and to call them the Asia Minor Rugs.</p>

  <p>Though a certain glamour attaches to all that comes from
  Persia, the Indes, or Far Cathay, in no part of the Orient are
  rugs woven on more classic ground than are the Asia Minor pieces.
  They are still made in the shadow of the walls where Cro[es]us
  lived and among villages where Homer trod. Their yarn is spun
  with crude distaff by the shepherd who still drives his flock
  along the same road where Artaxerxes marched, across the bridges
  that Roman legions built, and over the green slopes of Mt. Ida.
  In fact the names of some of them call to mind pictures of the
  Crusades, the journey of Paul, the march of Alexander&rsquo;s
  conquering army, and of cities founded before the beginning of
  history.</p>

  <p>When analysing the rugs of Asia Minor, it is necessary to make
  a distinction that has been previously noticed in the case of
  Persian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id=
  "Page_164">164</a></span> rugs, though with them it is less
  important. From the time when there arose a large demand in the
  markets of Europe and America for the rugs of the East the
  natural supply decreased, and, as a consequence, the price of
  those that remained increased. To meet this deficiency, and
  because of the higher prices, there was established a system by
  which large numbers of women and children were constantly
  employed; although many worked in their own homes, using such
  material as was furnished by their employers and receiving fixed
  daily wages. In the western and southern parts of Asia Minor,
  which are connected by railroads with seaports, are a number of
  communities where this system is in vogue. One of these is at
  Demirdji in the province of Smyrna, where there are a small
  number of looms; others are in the districts of Ghiordes and
  Kulah, which together have about one thousand looms; and Oushak,
  the principal rug-weaving centre of Asia Minor, has as many
  more.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Almost all rugs produced
  at such places are now shipped to Smyrna, which itself has but
  very few looms, or to Constantinople, whence they are reshipped
  to Western markets. These products lack much of the oldtime
  artistic spirit and individuality of character, on account of the
  dependence of the weavers on their employers, who demand the
  largest output consistent with fair quality. Furthermore, the
  weavers are frequently required to reproduce Western patterns.
  The result is that most of these rugs possess little of the
  firmness of texture, the harmonious relations of designs, and the
  excellent colour of old fabrics. Since, then, they represent in a
  measure European influences, and are subject to further changes
  to meet the demands of a fluctuating foreign taste, it would be
  of little use to describe them, especially as all their original
  characteristics exist in the old pieces.</p>

  <p>The striking features of Asia Minor rugs woven over fifty
  years ago are the colour schemes, main patterns, and the separate
  designs, which may be either independent of the pattern or
  constitute part of it. The colour effect of Asia Minor rugs is as
  a rule brighter than that of the Central Asian, Indian, or
  Persian groups; for the reds, blues, and yellows are less
  subdued. Some of their tones never appear in Chinese rugs, and on
  the whole they most closely resemble those of the Caucasian
  pieces; yet it is not unusual to see such colours as mauve,
  lavender, and canary yellow, that rarely appear even among these.
  Moreover, in a few of them masses of strongly
  contrasting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id=
  "Page_165">165</a></span> colours are placed beside one another
  without the customary shading of Persian rugs or the artificial
  device of Caucasian latch-hooks to soften the effect of harsh
  combinations.</p>

    <p class="center">MAP OF ASIA MINOR</p>
  </div>

  <p>The difference, nevertheless, between the Asia Minor rugs and
  those of other groups is less apparent in the colour schemes than
  in the main patterns, for in the Asia Minor rugs is evidence of
  an independent inspiration and development. There are lacking the
  rigid octagonal figures of the Central Asian groups; the frets
  and floral sprays distinctive of Chinese; the naturalistic floral
  treatment of the Indian; the delicate tracings, rhythm of
  movement, and wealth of foliage motives that characterise the
  Persian; as well as the severely geometric forms and
  conventionalised motives of the Caucasian. Instead of gracefully
  flowing lines we find strong rectangular ones; instead of flowers
  realistically balanced on interlacing, foliate stalks, they are
  arranged separately in formal rows. But if their patterns lack
  the fertility of invention or the refinement of Persian and
  Indian pieces, they excel them in the strength of their clear
  definition, accentuated by massing of colour. It is, however, in
  the prayer patterns, which appear in the majority of Asia Minor
  rugs, that the weavers attain their best results; for in such
  work they have the inspiration of a high religious as well as
  artistic spirit. In these patterns, which differ from those of
  any other group of rugs, is often manifest singular beauty and
  grace, as well as delicate sentiment derived from worship in
  Moslem chapels; for in many is represented the burning lamp that,
  projected against a background of sacred green, hangs from the
  column-supported arch, above which is spread a spandrel of blue
  typifying the vaulted heavens.</p>

  <p>Likewise many of the small designs that are found in other
  groups of rugs are rarely, if ever, seen in this one; as, for
  instance, animals, birds, fishes, and human beings are never
  employed, on account of the religious prejudice of the Sunnite
  Mohammedans, who prevail in the country. Nor, with very few
  exceptions, is the Herati design, so characteristic of Persian
  rugs, nor the pear design, so characteristic of both Persian and
  Indian rugs, ever seen. Furthermore, the reciprocal trefoil, that
  is used as a motive for a small border stripe in all Caucasian
  and many Persian rugs, is very rarely found in Asia. Minor pieces
  woven during the last two centuries, though it appears in some of
  an earlier era. But in its place are the water motive and ribbon,
  which are less frequently employed by the weavers of
  any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id=
  "Page_166">166</a></span> other country. There are also many
  small floral motives that appear only in Asia Minor rugs, and
  that will be noticed in connection with the separate classes.</p>

  <p>These characteristics of colour, pattern, and design are not
  the result of a spontaneous growth unalloyed by foreign
  influences; for a natural art never existed in Asia Minor, which
  has never enjoyed a national existence; but they are the results
  of artistic movements that at different times have swept over
  that country. Thus, as an heirloom of dynasties that once
  flourished farther east, are the Cufic characters that appear in
  some of the early border patterns; and as a relic of the Mongol
  and Timurid invasions are the dragon and other designs found in
  the oldest pieces. In Oushaks, as well as others, are seen the
  evidences of Persian treatment; while the drawing and colour
  schemes of the prayer rugs forcibly suggest Saracenic, Grecian,
  and Christian ideas. In fact, the rugs of Asia Minor, while
  possessing co-ordination of colour and design, are in a measure
  composite. They never reach the high artistic development of
  Persian rugs, because the latter were produced under the
  fostering care of great kings whose royal magnificence could
  secure from years of patient labour suitable furnishings for
  palaces and mosques; yet they are none the less interesting
  subjects for speculation and study.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Bergamos</span>.&mdash;In the
  valley of the Ca&iuml;cus and twenty miles from the &AElig;gean
  Sea is the city of Pergamus, that gives its name to the Bergamo
  rugs. It is of unknown antiquity, and may have stood when
  Agamemnon was warring with the house of Priam before the walls of
  that other city of the same name. In turn, Persians, Macedonians,
  Thracians, Syrians, and Romans had taken possession of it before
  the Apostle Paul founded there one of the seven churches of Asia.
  Greek sculptors chiselled its monuments, philosophers taught
  beneath the shade of its trees, and scholars gathered there the
  library that rivalled that of Alexandria. Partly encircled by
  mountains and enclosed by the wall of this old city, that was
  wellnigh destroyed during the Turkish wars, is the modern city of
  some fifteen thousand inhabitants. It is to-day one of the
  flourishing cities of the Levant, yet only in the surrounding
  ruins is there any reminder of its former greatness and
  splendour. But in these crumbling relics of the past and in the
  excellence of its woven fabrics of more recent times are traces
  of the artistic spirit that once prevailed there.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id=

  <p>It is still possible to obtain many good specimens of Bergamos
  representing the craftsmanship of fifty or more years ago, when
  aniline dyes and European patterns were unknown east of the
  Hellespont. Almost without exception they are sterling fabrics
  that glory in a wealth of colour accentuated by depth of pile and
  sheen of soft lustrous wool. An observer is at once impressed by
  the tones of deep blue and madder red that a few lines or patches
  of ivory white bring out more clearly, and forms a favourable
  estimate of the value of these pieces independently of the
  drawing, which seems subservient to the part of giving spirit and
  quality to the colour scheme. In fact, it is to the genius of the
  dyer who applies his knowledge to the tinting of carefully
  selected wool, and to the pains of the weaver in constructing the
  foundation of warp and weft rather than to his skill in arranging
  artistic designs, that these pieces command as high a price as
  old Kirmans of similar age.</p>

  <p>In two particulars Bergamos differ from most Asia Minor rugs:
  in shape they are nearly square, and prayer rugs are the
  exception rather than the rule. Nor do all the prayer rugs follow
  the same general pattern, as is usually the case with other
  classes. They may have low tent-shaped arches like those of
  Daghestans, high triangular arches with stepped sides and a panel
  above the spandrels as in the Kir-Shehrs, or they may have shapes
  unlike those of any other class. Moreover, the pieces not used as
  prayer rugs also have great diversity of pattern; but as a rule
  some large figure, as a medallion, occupies the centre of the
  field. Very frequently it is of hexagonal shape, with the sides
  at upper and lower ends of the rug serrated or fringed with
  latch-hooks. As is not the case with many of the Persian rugs,
  the field surrounding the medallion is almost always covered with
  small designs, arranged with careful precision so as to show a
  perfect balance with reference to the centre. Eight-pointed stars
  and other geometric figures are frequently used, but there is a
  leaning to floral designs, which, however, are often so
  conventionalised as almost to lose their identity. Most prominent
  of these is the Rhodian lily and the pomegranate; but the lily
  never shows such graceful drawing or such dainty colouring as in
  the Kulahs, and in some pieces even loses all resemblance to a
  floral form. The pomegranate, which suggests the Ladik, is more
  frequently seen in the main border stripe. Undulating vines do
  not find favour among the Bergamo weavers, and small isolated
  geometric designs are largely employed in the narrow border
  stripes, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id=
  "Page_168">168</a></span> larger, more complex figures often
  replace the floral in the main stripe.</p>

  <p>In no other class of rugs are so many and such painstaking
  devices to avert the spell of the evil eye. Should an unexpected
  visitor surprise the weaver while at work, he may be required to
  part with a bit of his frock, which is then attached to the wide
  web of the end; should a similar occurrence of ill omen follow,
  another bit of different material and colour may be sewn upon
  this; and as a crowning talisman, a button may be affixed to
  both. Small cowrie shells from the &AElig;gean shores are often
  used for such purposes; and now and then may be seen a woollen
  tassel dangling from the centre or from one of the ends of the
  rug.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red
  and blue, with minor quantities of yellow, white, and green.
  <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally five and one
  half to nine; perpendicularly, seven to eleven. The rows of knots
  are pressed down, so that the warp is concealed at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, wool; each of the two threads encircled by a knot is
  equally prominent at back. <i>Weft</i>, wool of fine diameter,
  dyed red. A thread of weft crosses from two to six times between
  every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool; generally of medium
  length but frequently long. <i>Border</i>, from one to four
  stripes; most frequently of three. <i>Sides</i>, a weft selvage
  of two, three, or four cords, coloured red or blue, with
  occasionally some green or yellow. <i>Both ends</i>, a web, that
  is sometimes six or seven inches wide, coloured red and crossed
  by broad longitudinal stripes, which are generally blue, but may
  be black, white, brown, or yellow. Some device to avert the evil
  eye is frequently attached to the webs. Beyond the web is a
  tasselled warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, moderately firm.
  <i>Weave</i> at back is of fine grain. <i>Usual length</i>, three
  to seven feet. <i>Usual width</i>, three quarters to nine tenths
  length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Ghiordes</span>.&mdash;Whether,
  as has been maintained, the town of Ghiordes, that lies a
  day&rsquo;s journey to the east of Pergamus, is on the site of
  the ancient Gordium where tradition says the father of Midas
  dedicated his chariot to Jupiter, and Alexander severed the bark
  which bound the pole to the yoke, it claims attention from the
  fact that the rugs woven there one and two centuries ago not only
  excelled similar products in all other parts of Asia Minor, but
  equalled the best fabrics woven in Persia during the same period.
  Indeed, a few connoisseurs would rank them still higher; yet with
  reference <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id=
  "Page_169">169</a></span>to technique of weave and delicacy of
  colour and drawing, very few should be classed with those woven
  in the previous century by the prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of Tamasp
  and Shah Abbas.</p>

  <p>So essentially do the modern rugs of the Ghiordes district
  differ from the old pieces in weave, colour, and pattern, and so
  great is their inferiority, that they have little interest; but
  fortunately it is still possible to purchase pieces from
  seventy-five to one hundred and fifty years of age, and others
  still older are in the hands of collectors or in museums. In
  determining their age the colours and drawing, as well as weave
  and pattern, are important indices. For instance, the reddish
  tones of the fields of pieces less than a century old have a
  pinkish or even magenta tinge, while in the oldest the red is of
  rich, deep colour. Similarly, in the case of blues, greens,
  yellows, and even the ivories that rarely occupy the field, a
  riper and richer colour marks the greater age. Likewise with the
  drawing, greater painstaking and higher artistic skill are
  apparent in the older rugs; though in some of the oldest the
  designs are less ornate than in those of a subsequent period.
  This is also true of the patterns as a whole; since the best
  types are found in rugs that are probably from one hundred and
  fifty to two hundred and fifty years old, whereas in the
  extremely old pieces there is an approach to archaic forms.</p>

  <p>The difference between the odjaliks and namazliks, which are
  the kinds most frequently seen, is most noticeable. The colours,
  to be sure, are much the same, though as a rule lighter and
  duller tones predominate in the odjaliks. Their borders show a
  greater tendency to use geometric figures, some of which are
  profusely fringed with latch-hooks suggestive of Caucasian
  influences. They also contain archaic designs believed to be
  associated with sun worship, as well as many floral forms common
  to the prayer rugs. It is, however, in the fields that the
  distinction is most noticeable; since the large masses of uniform
  colour that make the namazliks so effective are wanting, and
  instead are frequently seen hexagonal-shaped medallions that are
  fringed with large rounded latch-hooks and contain a lozenge or
  other geometric design in the centre. At both ends of the fields
  are sometimes narrow panels containing quasi-floral forms, and
  stiff conventions occupy the intervening corner spaces.</p>

  <p>In striking contrast to these odjaliks are the old Ghiordes
  prayer rugs, with the rich tones of solid colour in the fields
  and the delicate drawing of the borders. No doubt they were made
  with unusual care, since they were intended for religious
  purposes. The pattern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id=
  "Page_170">170</a></span> represents an entrance into a mosque;
  and it is not improbable that some of the earliest rugs were
  copied directly from archways, many of which still exist in
  Mohammedan countries.<a name="FNanchor_29" id=
  "FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
  Near the base of all Ghiordes arches, at each side, is a
  shoulder, which in old pieces was supported by a single pilaster
  or a pair. Sometimes these were ornamented with scroll work or
  floral forms, but finally many of them degenerated into floral
  devices that bore slight resemblance to columns, and in other
  rugs they have entirely disappeared. In some very old pieces the
  shoulders and the mihrab were rounded, but as a rule the
  shoulders are flattened at a very obtuse angle; and the mihrab is
  either plain or has stepped sides that culminate in a blunted
  apex. To further suggest the sacred purposes of the rug a lamp is
  often suspended from the niche, though floral forms may take its
  place, and not infrequently these too are wanting. Almost without
  exception some reminder of the tree of life, such as the small
  floral sprig or the Rhodian lily, is projected from the inner
  side of the arch and from all sides of the border against the
  field. In the spandrel, also, is almost invariably some floral or
  leaf form; though these may be very much conventionalised or even
  supplanted by geometric figures. Above the spandrel is a panel,
  which may contain some floral form, scroll device, or verse from
  the Koran; and another panel, though generally with different
  design, is almost invariably placed beneath the field. A scroll
  resembling a large S (Plate <a href="#po">O</a>, Fig. 9, Page
  291) frequently appears in these panels. Its resemblance to forms
  found in Armenian dragon carpets of earlier centuries is very
  noticeable.</p>

  <p>The border surrounding the field is as characteristic of this
  class as is the prayer arch. There are invariably a number of
  stripes, which generally consist of a wide central one, two
  secondary, and two or more small guard stripes. The drawing is
  distinctly floral, yet is widely different from the Persian. A
  design (Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 1, opp. Page 192)
  frequently seen in the central stripe represents a large palmette
  or rosette partly surrounded by leaves, suggestive of the Herati
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id=
  "Page_171">171</a></span> design, and connected by tendrils with
  more delicate flowers or leaves. But the more usual design (Plate
  <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 3) consists of flowers and fruits that
  are arranged in quadrangular shape, so that the alternate units
  face in different directions as they extend around the border.
  Though it is far from naturalistic, its delicate lace-like
  drawing with clear definition and its tones in harmony with the
  central field, contribute largely to the beauty of the rug. The
  secondary stripes have generally repetitive leaf forms; and
  running through the guard stripes is a simple vine, ribbon, or
  wave design. Occasionally, however, the typical Ghiordes border
  is replaced by one borrowed from the near district of Kulah, and
  instead of the broad central stripe are several narrow parallel
  stripes studded by perpendicular rows of small floral figures
  (Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 12). An unusual feature of these
  rugs is the linen nap which is sometimes used in the field
  instead of wool, for the reason that it retains its colour while
  wool darkens with age; and another is the silken fringe which is
  often seen at the corners of fine specimens. The nap is always
  short, and the rugs are closely woven.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  blue, yellow, and white. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch
  horizontally seven to twelve; perpendicularly, eight to sixteen.
  The rows of knots are pressed down, so that the warp is concealed
  and the weft is partly hidden at back. <i>Warp</i>, wool or
  cotton and in a few pieces raw silk. One of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is usually slightly depressed below the other
  at the back. <i>Weft</i>, wool or cotton. A thread of weft
  crosses twice between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool,
  and occasionally some cotton, clipped very short so as to be
  harsh to the touch. <i>Border</i>, six to nine stripes.
  <i>Sides</i>, a weft selvage of two or three cords, or only
  infrequently an added selvage of silk. <i>Both ends</i>, a narrow
  web and warp fringe. A few pieces have an added silk fringe at
  the corners. <i>Texture</i>, firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of
  very fine grain, but slightly rough. <i>Usual length</i>, five to
  seven feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two thirds to three quarters
  length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Kulahs</span>.&mdash;About
  fifty miles from Ghiordes, in a southeasterly direction, is the
  Turkish village of Kulah. Both places are surrounded by the same
  general character of hills and plains, and for the last several
  centuries the people of each have been subject to the same
  influences of race and religion. They have undoubtedly visited,
  intermarried, and become familiar with the arts and crafts of
  one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id=
  "Page_172">172</a></span> another. It is not, therefore,
  surprising that some of their rugs should have similar technique
  of weave, and that a few resemble one another in general pattern
  and small designs. Moreover, such a close correspondence exists
  between many of the old rugs of both districts, that even the
  most experienced are sometimes at a loss to distinguish between
  them. In fact it is surprising that there is so marked a
  distinction between most of them. In the Kulahs the border
  designs are not so elaborately drawn, nor are the prayer arches
  so high. They have rarely the fringe that adorns the corners of
  some Ghiordes rugs, or more than one panel. The field usually
  contains floral figures, arranged in formal order; the spandrel
  is almost always extended in two narrow stripes, one at each side
  of the field; and the colours are always subdued. These and other
  characteristics of each class make it possible to distinguish
  between most of them.</p>

  <p>As is the case with Ghiordes rugs, sedjadehs are almost
  unknown; but it is not unusual to see odjaliks. These resemble
  prayer rugs in the following respects: the borders are almost
  identical; the central fields contain the same floral figures
  resting on a similarly coloured ground; both ends of the
  hexagonal-shaped field resemble a mihrab; and the space between
  the field and border is covered with designs peculiar to the
  spandrels of the prayer rugs.</p>

  <p>On account of their artistic drawing and soft colours the
  prayer rugs are favourite pieces with all collectors. It is true
  that the arch is flatter than that of any other rug of this
  group, and is defined either by plain sloping lines, or more
  frequently by stepped edges, so that it lacks the classic beauty
  of the Ghiordes type; but on the other hand the Rhodian lily and
  other floral forms characteristic of these pieces are delineated
  with a realism and graceful delicacy that are unequalled in any
  other Asia Minor rugs. Arranged on slender sprays along each side
  of the field, hanging as long clusters from the niche in place of
  a lamp, or placed on the panel in formal rows, they accentuate
  with their bright tones the subdued richness of the ground
  colours. Sometimes, however, these simple field designs are
  replaced by more formal drawings that represent a plat of land
  with a tomb shaded by a tall cypress and other trees with many
  leafy branches. Rugs with these designs are not uncommon in
  Germany, whither large quantities of Asia Minor prayer rugs were
  shipped many years ago, and where they are known as
  &ldquo;Friedhofteppiche,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Grave Rugs,&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The most pleasing features are in the fields, but the most
  distinguishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id=
  "Page_173">173</a></span> features are in the borders,
  which are invariably of several stripes. Instead of the large
  central stripe with floral and repetitive designs common to most
  rugs is a series of parallel bands, from five to ten in number
  and about an inch in width, that contain rows of minute floral
  forms. These narrow bands are a distinguishing feature of the
  Kulahs, though they have occasionally been copied by the Ghiordes
  weavers. Nevertheless, they are sometimes replaced by the broad
  stripe containing rows of geometric-shaped designs, as in Plate
  <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 13 (opp. Page 192), which also are
  peculiar to these rugs. Strange as it may seem, these designs
  have doubtless been derived from leaf forms by successive
  degradation, as will be seen by comparing Figs. 13a, 13b, 13c,
  and 13d of Plate <a href="#po">O</a> (Page 291). There is still
  another border design that is so constantly found in the
  secondary stripe of these pieces and so rarely in any others that
  it might well be designated the &ldquo;Kulah stripe&rdquo; (Plate
  <a href="#ph">H</a>, Fig. 10, opp. Page 194). The design consists
  of a repetitive figure suggestive of some Chinese device, but is
  in reality a degraded form of a vine, as will be seen by
  observing some of the very old border stripes. Between the inner
  secondary stripe and the field is usually a narrow stripe
  containing a continuous ribbon design, or a simple vine-like
  form, as in Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 18 (opp. Page 158).
  Often a part of each succeeding undulation of the vine has been
  omitted and the remaining parts have been compressed, so as to
  leave small detached figures like a row of
  &ldquo;f&rsquo;s,&rdquo; as in Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>, Fig. 2.
  It is not unusual to see both vine and detached figures in the
  same rug.</p>

  <p>Diversity prevails in the colours of field, spandrel, panel,
  and borders. In the field is generally a mellowed red, or a
  yellow tint that is described both as golden brown and apricot;
  blue also is occasionally seen, and white is very rare. But
  whatever the colour of the field, that of the spandrel is
  generally a light blue, indicative of the sky, and the overlying
  panel is frequently a dark blue. Green and brown often appear in
  the border, as well as a canary yellow peculiar to Asia Minor
  rugs. Moreover, a few of these pieces have a single small area of
  red or blue, that was doubtless inserted to avert the evil eye,
  since it shows no more relation to the surrounding colours than
  spilt ink might have; yet in spite of these contrasts and the
  fact that the nap lacks the lustre peculiar to many other
  classes, some of them are as beautiful as Ghiordes.</p>

  <p>Between these old fabrics and the modern, which factory-like
  are produced in large quantities to meet the demands of a
  Western<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id=
  "Page_174">174</a></span> market and taste, is the most
  noticeable difference, for the latter are inferior to the former
  in patterns, weave, and dyes. Furthermore, with the wool of many
  is mixed mohair, so that rapid deterioration follows slight
  usage.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  brownish yellow, and blue, with minor quantities of green, dark
  brown, and white. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes, Knots to inch
  horizontally five to ten; perpendicularly, seven to twelve. The
  rows of knots are not firmly pressed down. <i>Warp</i>, wool; one
  of the two threads encircled by a knot is noticeably depressed at
  the back. <i>Weft</i>, in most rugs, of wool of medium diameter,
  sometimes dyed yellow. A thread of weft crosses twice between
  every two rows of knots. In other rugs, even very old, the weft
  consists of a coarse thread of jute crossing once between two
  rows of knots and alternating with a small thread of jute and
  another of wool crossing side by side once between the next two
  rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of short or medium length.
  <i>Border</i>, six to nine stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a coloured
  mixed selvage of two, three, or four cords. <i>Both ends</i>, a
  coloured web and warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, loose. <i>Weave</i>
  at back is of moderately coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, five
  to seven feet. <i>Usual width</i>, three fifths to three quarters
  length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Oushaks</span>.&mdash;Fifty
  miles eastward from Kulah is the city of Oushak, famous during
  the XV and XVI Centuries for the carpets exported thence to
  Europe to adorn the halls of cathedrals and thrones of monarchs.
  But with the subsequent decadence in Asiatic art its glory ebbed,
  so that half a century ago it was but a small mud-housed city
  known for the excellence of its dyes and the wool which was taken
  there from the interior to be washed, spun, and then sold to the
  weavers of the surrounding country. Since then, however, its
  population has steadily grown, and the weaving industry has
  thrived, until now it is one of the most populous cities of Asia
  Minor, with looms more numerous than those of any other city. The
  weaving is done entirely by women and girls, most of whom are
  Mohammedans. Though they live principally in private houses, they
  are under the direction of large firms, who furnish the wool as
  well as the patterns, which are in accordance with European and
  American demands.</p>

  <p>Important distinctions exist between the different grades of
  these rugs. Some are known as &ldquo;Turkish Kirmans,&rdquo; in
  which Persian designs are frequently introduced, others are of
  still finer workman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id=
  "Page_175">175</a></span>ship, but the oldest and coarsest pieces
  were formerly known as &ldquo;Yapraks.&rdquo; These are
  distinguishable by their strong colours of red, green, and blue,
  of which only two as a rule are seen in a single rug, and are
  massed to produce striking effects. Their foundation of warp and
  weft, which are dyed in the same colours, is loosely woven and
  often of an inferior grade of wool. Many of them are too large
  and heavy for domestic use, but are well adapted for salons and
  public halls.</p>

  <p>With such slight variations in pattern and none in colour,
  Oushaks would be of little interest were it not that their
  prototypes were striking pieces woven by artisans whom Sultan
  Solyman the Magnificent brought from the northwestern part of
  Persia, when he conquered it in the XVI Century. Some of them
  appear in the paintings of old masters, and when contrasted with
  the modern fabrics indicate how great is the decline in the
  craftsmanship of the weavers. Of the beautiful well-balanced
  designs once represented in the fields, only large stars and
  diamonds, defined by less pleasing lines and placed with less
  regularity, remain. All of the graceful arabesques and dainty
  floral motives that appeared as sub-patterns are omitted. As
  works of art, the modern products are little esteemed; but their
  durability, depth of pile, and wealth of colour make them
  excellent objects of utility.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  blue, and green. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch
  horizontally four to eight; perpendicularly, four to nine. A half
  knot, as it appears at back, is longer than wide. The rows of
  knots are not closely pressed down. <i>Warp</i>, wool. Each of
  the two threads encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back,
  or one is slightly depressed below the other. <i>Weft</i>, wool
  of medium diameter and generally dyed red. A thread of weft
  crosses twice between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool,
  clipped long. <i>Border</i>, usually of three stripes.
  <i>Sides</i>, generally a double overcasting, occasionally a
  selvage. <i>Both ends</i>, generally a web coloured red and a
  warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, very loose. <i>Weave</i> at back is
  of moderately coarse grain. <i>Length</i>, carpet sizes. <i>Usual
  width</i>, two thirds to four fifths length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Ak-hissar</span>.&mdash;Almost
  seventy-five miles by rail from Smyrna and a short distance to
  the west of Ghiordes is the Turkish town of Ak-Hissar, the White
  Citadel. Even before the building of the railroad rugs were woven
  in this district; and in recent years the<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
  work-house system has been established, and large quantities,
  that bear some resemblance to the modern products of Kulah and
  Oushak, have been exported.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Demirdji</span>.&mdash;Half a
  century ago the town of Demirdji was almost uninhabited; but as a
  result of the Occidental demand for Oriental rugs and the
  disappearance of old pieces, it has grown to be an important
  manufacturing centre. Many of its weavers learned their trade at
  the historic Ghiordes, which is about twenty-five miles distant;
  but the fabrics are more closely woven and the wool is more
  carefully selected than is the case with the modern Ghiordes.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Kutayah</span>.&mdash;On the
  main railroad that will eventually connect the Bosphorus with the
  Euphrates is the town of Kutayah. As it is on the edge of the
  Anatolian plateau, wool and goat&rsquo;s hair have been for a
  long period important articles in its trade. Both of them are now
  used in the local manufacture of rugs, which in a measure
  resemble the products of Oushak.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Smyrna</span>.&mdash;The
  location of Smyrna on a magnificent harbour and its connection by
  rail with all the important rug districts of the interior, have
  made it the principal centre for the export trade in Asia Minor
  rugs. Many of the people are also largely engaged in the industry
  of weaving, but almost all weavers are now in the employ of large
  companies who furnish the materials and patterns. As a result,
  the Smyrna rugs are mere copies of well-known types of other
  Turkish pieces, or, as is generally the case, of stereotyped
  patterns that have been evolved to meet the requirements of
  European and American tastes. Many of the rugs, to be sure, are
  well woven and serviceable, but they lack individuality of
  character.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Melez</span>.&mdash;About
  seventy-five miles to the south of Smyrna and twenty from the
  Mediterranean Sea is the town of Melassa, or Melez. It is now
  little known, but was once the market place of an important
  rug-producing district, which included a large part of the
  classic province of Caria. Accordingly, the pieces that came from
  there were sometimes called Carian, but are more generally known
  as Melez.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 40. Kabistan
    Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>On their face they show a close relationship to the
  Anatolians, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id=
  "Page_177">177</a></span>and also, though in a less degree, to
  many other Asia Minor rugs; yet as is to be expected of the
  products from one corner of the country, they have a distinct
  individuality in both pattern and colour. Occasionally an old
  piece is seen, in which the border is very narrow and the whole
  field is covered with parallel stripes on which are
  systematically arranged geometric and semi-floral forms; but as a
  rule the fields are not much wider, and often less wide, than
  each of the adjacent borders. Within this central space are
  frequently arranged prominent designs, which are widely different
  from the designs of any other rugs, and are suggestive of Chinese
  ornament, but were doubtless derived from floral or tree forms
  (Plate <a href="#po">O</a>, Fig. 12, Page 291). Moreover,
  projecting in regular order from the alternate sides of the
  narrow border stripe, next to the field, are sometimes seen
  thumb-like figures, that fit against one another like the cogs of
  a wheel (Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>, Fig. 15, opp. Page 194). Each
  of these features, though not always present, is peculiar to this
  class.</p>

  <p>Of the several border stripes, the central is generally as
  wide as the remainder and not altogether dissimilar to that of
  the Ladiks. Very frequently it consists of a row of palmettes
  between which are conventionalised leaves and flowers on slender
  stems; but now and then the palmettes are replaced by
  eight-pointed stars or other geometric figures, and the
  intervening spaces filled with corresponding designs. The
  secondary stripes are of a pronounced Caucasian type; and almost
  invariably in a smaller tertiary stripe is represented a waving
  line or the reciprocal sawtooth.</p>

  <p>The prayer rugs are equally characteristic. In typical
  examples the lines defining the mihrab descend from the niche to
  meet the sides of the narrow field at an angle of forty-five
  degrees, and are then deflected towards its centre, to return
  again to its sides. The resulting drawing shows two equilateral
  triangles on each side of the field at the base of the mihrab,
  which in conjunction with the upper sides of the triangles has
  the appearance of an incomplete diamond. This effect, moreover,
  is frequently accentuated by a perpendicular row of diamonds
  extending from just below the niche to the base of the field. The
  sides of mihrab, field, and central designs are, as a rule,
  fringed with small geometric or conventionalised floral forms;
  and in the spacious spandrel are more realistic floral designs
  arranged on a trellis-like sub-pattern.</p>

  <p>This individuality of pattern is accompanied by a less marked
  yet noticeable individuality of colour scheme. As is the case
  with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id=
  "Page_178">178</a></span> many Bergamos, the principal tone is a
  dark red, which generally appears in the central field, and is
  also used almost without exception in the broad end webs, the
  side selvages, and the threads of weft. Ivory white for the
  spandrel, some yellow and green for the borders, are common
  colours; but the one that rarely appears in any appreciable
  quantity in other rugs is a characteristic tone of lavender or
  mauve, which is present in almost every old Melez. Not always are
  these tones pleasing, as many of the rugs have been poorly dyed;
  but there are other pieces, now rapidly growing scarce, of which
  the colours are exceedingly rich and harmonious.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  with minor quantities of blue, yellow, white, and some mauve.
  <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally five to eight;
  perpendicularly, six to eleven. A half knot, as it appears at
  back, is as long as wide or slightly longer. The rows of knots
  are not closely pressed down, yet the warp does not show at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, wool; each of the two threads encircled by a knot is
  equally prominent at back. <i>Weft</i>, wool of small diameter,
  dyed blue or red. A thread of weft generally crosses four times
  between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium
  length and sometimes short. <i>Border</i>, wide, from three to
  seven stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a selvage of two to four cords,
  usually coloured red. <i>Lower end</i>, a red web and loose warp
  fringe. <i>Upper end</i>, a red web, a braided selvage, and loose
  warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, moderately loose. <i>Weave</i> at
  back is of slightly coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, four and
  one half to six feet. <i>Usual width</i>, three fifths to three
  quarters length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Isbarta.</span>&mdash;In the
  town of Isbarta in the southern part of the province of Konieh
  are woven rugs which are sometimes known to the trade as
  &ldquo;Spartas.&rdquo; Like many other pieces made to meet the
  Western demand, they lack spontaneous individuality, but are
  often of excellent quality and coloured in delicate tones,
  arranged harmoniously.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Rhodian.</span>&mdash;Even at a
  very early period the people of the islands bordering the
  southwestern coast of Asia Minor produced textile fabrics that
  rivalled many of the best products of the mainland. None of them
  were more beautiful or more interesting than those which came
  from the Island of Rhodes, where were blended the vigorous
  Grecian and the more subtle Oriental arts. Here was the
  inspi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id=
  "Page_179">179</a></span>ration of the sea, cloudless skies,
  luxuriant vegetation. Here was felt the deep influence of the
  Mohammedan and Christian religions, as well as an early pagan
  mythology; and there is little doubt that the cathedral walls and
  picturesque church of the valiant knights of St. John made an
  impression on the weavers. It is not surprising, therefore, that
  the fabrics should be of deep, rich colour full of suggestion,
  and that the drawing of the long central panels should remind one
  of cathedral windows.</p>

  <p>Of the many beautiful rugs formerly woven in Rhodes only a few
  now remain, and these are generally in the hands of collectors.
  Some are odjaliks, some namazliks, some sedjadehs; but all, with
  the exception of a few crude and coarsely woven pieces, have
  colours and weave that bespeak a ripe age, amounting in many
  instances to one hundred years or more. On the field of odjaliks
  are represented as a rule the usual hexagonal figure with two
  sides at each end forming a triangle; and on the fields of the
  namazliks are prayer arches which, though characteristic, never
  equal the graceful drawing seen in Ghiordes rugs. It is the
  sedjadehs that awaken the greatest interest, as they have some
  striking peculiarities rarely seen in rugs of the mainland.</p>

  <p>Their field is divided into two or three panels that extend
  almost the full length of the field, and terminate at one end in
  flat and often serrated arches. The spandrels are small; and
  placed transversely above them is a low panel, that contains
  designs of mechanically drawn leaves, vandykes resembling those
  of Ladiks, and other figures common to Asia Minor rugs. In fact,
  these pieces at once suggest prayer rugs containing two or more
  prayer arches, but the pattern is generally regarded as a
  representation of cathedral windows. Both colouring and designs
  give force to this idea. In each of the principal panels is a
  different ground colour, as red, blue, or green, which is never
  gaudy, yet exceedingly rich on account of the depth of pile; and
  in the overlying figures there is often a strangely contrasting
  splendour of brighter colouring. Furthermore, one of the most
  usual of these designs, arranged like pole medallions, consists
  of large eight-pointed stars with effulgent rays of brilliant
  hues. As we look at some of the rare old pieces with this
  pattern, cathedral windows almost appear before us with bright
  sunshine streaming in golden rays through the stained glass and
  brightening the interior with its more sombre tones of &ldquo;dim
  religious light.&rdquo; Sometimes the pole design is modified so
  as to suggest a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id=
  "Page_180">180</a></span> tree of life extending from one end of
  the panel to the other. An equally common design represents six
  very mechanically drawn leaves assembled in the form of a
  medallion (Plate <a href="#po">O</a>, Fig. 15, Page 291). Each of
  these leaves has two straight edges meeting at right angles and
  containing at the corner a small rectangular spot; but the
  remaining sides that form the circumference of the medallion are
  deeply serrated, so as to produce much the same effect as the
  rays of effulgent stars. In the fields are also frequently seen
  latch-hooks, and occasionally checkerboards with different
  colours for separate squares.</p>

  <p>Between field and border is a close correspondence in both
  colours and small designs. The latter consist principally of
  geometric and semi-floral forms, as eight-pointed stars, the
  octagonal disc, and the geometric leaf that is typical of Kulah
  rugs. No other design is more prevalent than the last, which may
  be found in all parts of these rugs. Sometimes it is drawn most
  realistically so as to resemble the flower forms so common in
  spandrels of Kulahs; but again the outlines are most conventional
  with square-like projections at the edges and a bar of underlying
  field of contrasting colour crossing the face diagonally, as in
  the border stripe of Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 13, (opp.
  Page 192), which shows the foliate origin of the latter.</p>

  <p>The name &ldquo;Makri&rdquo; is frequently applied to these
  rugs, since they were often bought in the city of that name,
  which is one of the harbours of Southwestern Asia Minor nearest
  to Rhodes.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Broussa.</span>&mdash;At the
  base of Mt. Olympus and distant only twenty-five miles from the
  Sea of Marmora, with which it is connected by rail, is the city
  of Broussa. By reason of this location and its proximity to
  Constantinople, it is an important commercial centre; and on
  account of the excellence of the wool and silk obtained in the
  surrounding country, rugs are woven here for foreign markets. The
  fabrics are stoutly made and compare favourably with those of
  Smyrna.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Hereke.</span>&mdash;In the
  town of Hereke, on the Sea of Marmora, is a Turkish factory,
  where large numbers of silk rugs are manufactured. Most of the
  silk is obtained in the immediate neighbourhood and from the
  country about Mt. Olympus. As the early weavers were brought from
  Kirman to instruct the artisans of the Sultan, and the patterns
  have been largely copied from old Persian and Asia Minor pieces,
  it is not surprising that many of the fabrics compare favourably
  with the silk rugs of Persia.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Koniehs.</span>&mdash;At the
  base of Mt. Taurus and overlooking the salt desert of Central
  Asia Minor is the city of Konieh. Within its present walls is all
  that is left of the ancient Iconium that opened its gates to
  Xenophon, Cyrus, and Alexander, but drove forth the Apostle Paul.
  Finally it surrendered to Seljukian conquerors, who, realising
  the importance of its situation on one of the great highways
  between east and west and in an oasis of well-watered fields,
  orchards, and gardens which face a great barren plain,
  established there a Mussulman capital, that became noted for its
  opulence and culture. In later years it successfully resisted the
  assault of Frederic Barbarossa; but subsequently it declined,
  until now the only remaining vestiges of its former importance
  are several colleges, one hundred mosques, and the famous green
  tower surmounting the tomb of the whirling dervishes.</p>

  <p>In few other cities of Asia Minor were greater inducements
  offered to the rug weavers. Surrounding them lay hills and plains
  that produced sheep with soft, fine fleeces. On the oaks that
  grew not far to the north lived the kermes, from which were
  obtained the vermilion dyes famous even through Persia. The
  political and com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id=
  "Page_182">182</a></span>mercial importance of the city, as well
  as the religious fanaticism of the people, aided them.
  Accordingly a great many choice pieces were formerly woven there,
  but on account of the remoteness of the city from the markets
  that supplied Europe, few found their way into channels of
  trade.</p>

  <p>Large numbers were used solely for religious purposes, but
  other kinds are as frequently seen. All of them contain both
  geometric and floral forms. The geometric forms resemble designs
  prevalent in Eastern Anatolia and in Caucasia, such as
  latch-hooks, eight-pointed stars, and barber-pole stripes; and
  the floral forms consist of mechanically drawn palm leaves and
  the tree-of-life design.</p>

  <p>Probably in no other Asia Minor rug is such latitude in the
  drawing of the prayer arch. Sometimes it begins below the middle
  of the field and rises at a sharp angle to a point near the upper
  end; again it may be exceedingly flat; but generally it has the
  same pitch as the arches of Kulahs, and, like them, the sides, as
  a rule, are stepped or serrated. Furthermore, it is not unusual
  to see latch-hooks projecting from each step or serration into
  the spandrel, which is filled with small floral and geometric
  forms. From the niche is occasionally suspended a lamp; and
  arranged against the border, on each side of the field, is a row
  of conventionalised flowers, or small sprigs which resemble three
  triangular-shaped petals at the end of a straight stem. These
  floral or foliate designs are one of the most constant features
  of this class. The borders are more geometric than those of
  almost any other Asia Minor rugs, and even when vines are
  represented they are drawn with stiff formality.</p>

  <p>Whatever may be lacking in artistic drawing is frequently
  atoned for by the excellence of the colour scheme, which
  occasionally rivals that of the Ghiordes and Kulahs. Rich reds or
  blues are almost invariably found in the fields, where there is
  sufficient depth of nap to enhance their richness; and the
  borders are brightened by attractive tones of yellow, green, and
  white. Contrasted with these old pieces, the modern rugs of
  Konieh have little artistic merit, but are large pieces desirable
  solely for their durability.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red
  and blue, with minor quantities of yellow, green, and white.
  <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally five to eight;
  perpendicularly, six to ten. The rows of knots are not very
  firmly pressed down. <i>Warp</i>, wool; each of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back. <i>Weft</i>,
  wool, of medium diameter, dyed red. A thread of weft
  crosses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id=
  "Page_183">183</a></span> twice between every two rows of knots.
  <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium length. <i>Border</i>, from two to
  five stripes, with frequently an outer edging. <i>Sides</i>,
  generally a selvage of two or three cords, but occasionally an
  overcasting. <i>Both ends</i>, a web and warp fringe.
  <i>Texture</i>, only moderately firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of
  slightly coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, four and one half to
  six feet. <i>Usual width</i>, three fifths to three quarters
  length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Ladiks.</span>&mdash;On the
  ruins of ancient Laodicea is the mud-walled town of the village
  of Ladik, once the centre of an important rug industry. Among the
  surrounding hills are still woven pieces which resemble in
  pattern, though they poorly imitate in weave and colour, the
  early prototypes that have been classed among the masterpieces of
  Asia Minor. Few of these old rugs remain, and they are often
  badly worn in spots; yet they display tones mellowed by the touch
  of more than a century, and rival the Ghiordes in beauty of
  design.</p>

  <p>As is the case with other classes of rugs woven in Turkish
  countries, the sedjadehs and odjaliks lack the interesting
  details of the namazliks, from which they widely differ. On the
  central fields of many of them are oblong hexagonal-shaped
  medallions, often three in number, that contain designs of stars
  or other geometric figures. Between the fields and the borders of
  the ends are generally spacious panels, on which are represented
  rows of vandykes. These figures are one of the most permanent
  characteristics of this class of rugs; and though their origin is
  uncertain, it is not improbable that they are derived from
  arrowheads, which were one of the emblems of the Chaldean deity
  Hoa, the reputed inventor of Cufic writing. The borders are also
  geometric, consisting, as a rule, of three stripes, of which the
  central contains an angular vine that in different pieces may be
  very simple or very ornate. One of the central stripes often
  adopted is represented in Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 10
  (opp. Page 192) and shows a vine with conventionalised leaf.
  Latch-hooks are common in the sedjadehs, and when floral forms
  are present the fact is generally disguised by the harsh,
  mechanical drawing.</p>

  <p>In contrast with these pieces, the namazliks with their
  interesting arches and dainty drawing are most pleasing. In a
  large number of them the central fields occupy about one half the
  space within the border, the spandrels extend for a considerable
  distance above the arch, and the panels are larger than in any
  other prayer rug. Occasionally arches resembling those of the
  Ghiordes or Kir-Shehrs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184"
  id="Page_184">184</a></span> are seen; but they are to be
  regarded merely as copies, since the typical arch differs widely
  from any other and gives to this class one of its greatest
  charms. Instead of rising to the apex in lines of many
  serrations, each side of the arch rises from the border and falls
  in one large serration, then rises again to form the niche. The
  arch is often fringed with latch-hooks, and extending above the
  apex of each serration and the niche are perpendicular devices
  that may, also, be a development of the latch-hook, since they
  have not been traced to any other satisfactory origin. But
  whatever their origin may be, their shape as well as that of the
  arch at once suggests Saracenic mosques. In the spandrel are
  constantly seen serrated leaves, rosettes, and designs peculiar
  to the Ladik. The large panel is equally typical, and consists of
  reciprocally drawn vandykes, from which rise perpendicular stems
  supporting leaves and pomegranates. These are generally five in
  number, and are so gracefully and naturalistically drawn that it
  seems surprising that the vandykes, from which they spring, are
  ornamented with a profusion of latch-hooks. The central fields
  are sometimes without ornament, but as a rule they contain some
  suggestions of the tree of life either in the central design or
  in the three-leaf sprigs arranged about the borders. The latter
  are as characteristic as any other part of the rug, and consist
  of four stripes separated by dotted lines. The main stripe most
  frequently contains a row of delicately drawn lilies alternating
  with rosettes, though occasionally a very formal vine with
  conventionalised leaf is substituted for it. In the stripes at
  each side are very angular vines with three-cleft leaves, and in
  the narrow innermost stripe is generally a ribbon pattern.</p>

  <p>All of the drawing has clear definition accentuated by rich
  and strongly contrasting colours. The fields of the namazliks,
  like those of the Ghiordes, are entirely occupied by masses of
  unshaded blue, red, or brown, that are relieved only by the
  colours of superimposed designs. But as is not the case with
  Ghiordes, there is often a strong contrast between the colours of
  centre and ends; yet the tones are always in perfect harmony.
  Other rugs may have more delicate drawing or more exquisite
  finish; but in the barbaric arrangement of strong colour and in
  the uniqueness of graceful designs, none exceed the old prayer
  Ladiks.</p>

  so that the warp is concealed at back. <i>Warp</i>, wool. One of
  the two threads encircled by a knot is generally depressed below
  the other at the back. <i>Weft</i>, wool of fine diameter,
  generally dyed red. A thread of weft crosses twice between every

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Kir-Shehrs.</span>&mdash;To the
  north of the great salt desert and in the southern part of the
  province of Angora is the town of Kir-Shehr. It stands between
  two mountain ranges, on which are raised sheep with fine fleeces,
  and is on the branch of the Kizil Irmak, whose waters are well
  suited for preparing wool for the dyes obtained in the
  surrounding country. On account of the excellence of wool, water,
  and natural dyes, as well as the remoteness of the town from main
  highways of travel, many of the old rugs were excellent pieces,
  free from the taint of Western influences, and possessing the
  charm of individuality. It was due, moreover, to the fact that
  its three or four thousand inhabitants, and the Turkomans who
  roamed the surrounding country, rarely felt the influence of
  larger cities that they were so untrammelled by
  conventionalities. Unhesitatingly they grouped together large
  spaces of red, yellow, and blue, as well as grass-coloured green,
  for which they had a particular fondness and employed to a
  greater extent than almost any other weavers; yet in the case of
  these old pieces the artistic sense is rarely shocked, since the
  individual colours are good and the tones are harmonious.
  Furthermore, the patterns show an unusual blending of floral and
  geometric forms.</p>

  <p>Most of the pieces come in moderate sizes; some are mats,
  others small sedjadehs, but the choicest are the prayer rugs. The
  serrated sides of the arch, which rise at a steep angle from the
  centres of each side of the rather narrow fields, are formed of
  several parallel lines of different colour. In a not unusual rug,
  for instance, eight narrow lines separating the spandrel of
  grass-green from the inner field of brick-red appeared in the
  following order: red, black, white, yellow, lavender, yellow,
  red, and blue. The inmost line is fre<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>quently
  fringed with tri-cleft floral forms, which, as in Koniehs, extend
  in a row along the sides of the field. From the niche is usually
  suspended the design of an inverted tree of life, and above it
  are projected latch-hooks or similar devices. It is not unusual
  to see two arches, and there are sometimes as many as four,
  placed one within the other. The spacious spandrel that is
  continued in narrow stripes along the borders to the bottom of
  the field is covered with geometric or conventionalised floral
  forms; and the horizontal panel, which may be placed at either
  end of the field, contains designs in harmony with the remaining
  parts.</p>

  <p>On the whole, the wide borders have some of the most
  characteristic features; for, as a rule, not only are one or two
  of the stripes of a peculiar cherry red and one a rich yellow,
  but three or four of the narrow stripes next to the field are
  similar in width and ornamentation to those of the Kulah. When
  contrasted with them the broad central stripe and the outer one
  seem lacking in harmony, for they are distinctly floral and
  suggestive of Persian influences.</p>

  <p>On account of the quality of their wool and weave, these rugs
  are soft and flexible. They resemble in some minor details others
  of the Anatolian plateau, yet they can be distinguished by the
  presence of grass-green colour and the shape of the prayer arch.
  The nap of these old pieces, like that of Kulahs and Ladiks, is
  of medium length; though in modern pieces it is often longer, and
  the weft and webs are coloured as are those of Bergamos.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red
  and green, also some blue, brown, and white. Knot, Ghiordes.
  <i>Knots</i> to inch horizontally five to nine; perpendicularly,
  five to ten. A half knot as it appears at back is as long as, or
  longer than, wide. The rows of knots are not firmly pressed down,
  so that in places the warp shows. <i>Warp</i>, wool; each of the
  two threads encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back, or
  occasionally one is slightly depressed. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of
  medium or coarse diameter and generally of different colours in
  the same rug. A thread of weft crosses from two to six times
  between two rows of knots, varying in the same rug. <i>Pile</i>,
  wool, of medium length. <i>Border</i>, from five to eight
  stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a weft selvage of two, three, or four
  cords of different colours. <i>Lower end</i>, web and warp loops.
  <i>Upper end</i>, a web and warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, loose.
  <i>Weave</i> at back is of coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>,
  four to six feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two thirds to four fifths
  length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id=
  "Page_187">187</a></span><span class=
  "smcap">Anatolians.</span>&mdash;To all of Asia Minor was once
  applied the term &ldquo;Anatolia,&rdquo; which signifies the Land
  of the Rising Sun; so that any product of this country might well
  be called Anatolian, just as any product of Persia might be
  called Iranian. In fact, many of the less known classes, as the
  Nigde, Tuzla, Mudjar, and even the Kir-Shehr, Melez, and Konieh,
  are often called Anatolian. But as there is a special type of
  rugs known as Iranians, so is there a special type known as
  Anatolians. They are, however, a mixed lot, that come from parts
  of a wide stretch of territory, extending over the interior
  table-land to the home of the Kurds, and incorporating ideas
  received from many districts. It is, accordingly, difficult to
  define them as a type; but, as a rule, they are small pieces that
  are often used for mats and pillows, with moderately long nap of
  soft, floccy wool, with narrow borders, and a colour scheme that
  inclines to bright and sometimes garish colours.</p>

  <p>Doubtless the best of them come from the provinces of Angora
  and Konieh, lying within a radius of one hundred miles of Lake
  Tuz Gul. Here can be obtained the best of wool and dyes; and in
  some of the old pieces appears the artistic drawing of the more
  important rug centres farther to the west, but with a strange
  blending of geometric and floral forms. Eight-pointed stars as
  well as latch-hooks are seen everywhere, and a very old design
  with the shape of ram&rsquo;s horns is frequently used. In many
  of the prayer rugs the arches are of the Kir-Shehr order, though
  the panels may contain vandykes suggestive of Ladiks. There is
  the greatest latitude in the width of the borders, which
  occasionally are their most noticeable feature and again are most
  insignificant; but in either case they rarely contain more than
  three stripes, and not infrequently only one. Red, blue, green,
  and brown are the usual colours, but pink and canary yellow are
  sometimes used.</p>

  <p>Farther to the east, among the foot-hills of the Anti-Taurus
  mountains, is woven a coarser type by the Kurdish tribes. With
  the exception of wool and dyes they have little to their credit;
  for their usual unsymmetric shapes, crude geometric designs, long
  uneven nap, and braided fringe of warp at the ends are lacking in
  all elegance.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  blue, green, brown, and white. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to
  inch horizontally five to nine; perpendicularly, six to twelve. A
  half knot, as it appears at back, is generally as long as wide,
  or longer. The rows of knots are not firmly pressed down, yet the
  warp is frequently concealed<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span> at back. <i>Warp</i>,
  wool; each of the two threads encircled by a knot is equally
  prominent at back. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of medium or coarse
  diameter and usually dyed, A thread of weft crosses two, three,
  and four times between two rows of knots frequently varying in
  the same piece. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium length.
  <i>Border</i>, one to three stripes, and occasionally an edging.
  <i>Sides</i>, a weft selvage of two or three cords. <i>Both
  ends</i>, a web and warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, loose.
  <i>Weave</i> at back is of coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, two
  and one half to six feet. <i>Usual width</i>, one half to two
  thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Karamans.</span>&mdash;At the
  foot of Mt. Taurus and overlooking the plain that stretches
  northward into the heart of Asia Minor is the city of Karaman.
  Before its subjection in the XV Century by Bajazet II and the
  removal of the capital to Konieh, that lies sixty miles to the
  northwest, it was the seat of a Turkish government extending to
  the Mediterranean Sea; but to-day the only reminder of its early
  importance are several Saracenic mosques covered with rich
  arabesques. Of the rugs woven there during the early period
  almost nothing is known, but, on account of the former importance
  of the city, it is not improbable that they compared favourably
  with the rugs of other parts of the Turkish Empire. On the other
  hand, some of the modern products are among the poorest rugs of
  the East, and contain little artistic merit. A feature peculiar
  to many of them is the use of natural wool of reddish brown
  colour, obtained from sheep which live on the mountain ranges to
  the south of Karaman. The pile is long, the weave is never very
  firm, and at each end is a coloured web.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Sivas.</span>&mdash;In the city
  of Sivas, at the eastern end of Anatolia, and in the villages of
  the surrounding plain, girls and women have woven rugs from time
  immemorial; but on account of the difficulties of transportation
  few of them reach this country. The carefully finished sides and
  ends, the formal character of the pattern, and the almost harsh
  effect of the strongly contrasting colours of many of them are
  unlike what are found in the nomadic rugs made farther to the
  east and west. In the weave is a hint of Persian influence; for
  not only are both warp and weft of cotton, but the warp is of
  small diameter and well spun, and one of the two threads to which
  a knot is tied is depressed below the other. The pattern, on the
  other hand, is distinctly Turkish. One of the best known types
  consists <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id=
  "Page_189">189</a></span>of a large hexagon that reaches to the
  sides and ends, and contains within it a medallion on which are
  designs similar to those seen in Bergamos. On the white field
  surrounding the medallion are often small rosettes and floral
  figures. The corners of the field may be fringed with running
  latch-hooks or a row of formal T&rsquo;s, and contain a rosette
  at their centre. The borders are rarely wide, and often consist
  of a single stripe that contains some conventionalised floral
  form. Although these rugs are well woven, their crude blending of
  floral and geometric figures, as well as their formality of
  drawing, which is accentuated by the shortness of the nap, are
  most suggestive of Occidental conventions.</p>

  so that the warp does not show at back. <i>Warp</i>, cotton, well
  spun and of small diameter. One of the two threads encircled by a
  knot is depressed below the other at back and sometimes doubled
  under the other. <i>Weft</i>, cotton, of medium diameter. A
  thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows of knots.
  <i>Pile</i>, wool of short to medium length. <i>Border</i>,
  narrow, one to three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, an added selvage of
  four or five cords attached in places, and with weft encircling
  inner cord of selvage. <i>Both ends</i>, narrow web and loose
  warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is only
  slightly coarse. <i>Usual length</i>, three and one half to six
  and one half feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two thirds to four fifths
  length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Mudjars.</span>&mdash;Near the
  river Kizil Irmak in Central Asia Minor is the city of Mudjar,
  which produces rugs that occasionally reach this country. They
  are often classed as Anatolians, but their colour scheme covers a
  wider range, including red, yellow, green, blue, mauve, and pink,
  all of which may be seen in the same piece. In fact no other rug
  of Asia Minor contains as a rule so many colours, which appear in
  the broad borders of old, well-woven pieces with glistening wool
  almost like mosaic work. Many of this class are namazliks with
  arches very similar to the arches in the rugs of Kir-Shehr, which
  is distant only twenty-five miles to the north; and in the panels
  above the spandrel are not infrequently designs of vandykes
  borrowed from the Ladiks. Some suggestion of the tree of life
  often appears in the field, and again rows of flowers
  may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id=
  "Page_190">190</a></span> extend into it from the sides. Some of
  the best examples are very handsome.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  yellow, blue, green, and ivory, also mauve and pink. <i>Knot</i>,
  Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally six to nine;
  perpendicularly, seven to twelve. <i>Warp</i>, wool. Each of the
  two threads of warp encircled by a knot is frequently equally
  prominent at the back, but generally one is depressed below the
  other. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of medium to coarse diameter dyed red
  or brown. A thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows
  of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool of medium length. <i>Border</i>,
  broad, of three to four stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a three-cord
  selvage, frequently red. <i>Both ends</i>, coloured webs and
  fringe. <i>Texture</i>, loose. <i>Weave</i>, moderately coarse.
  <i>Usual length</i>, four to six feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two
  thirds to three quarters length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Nigdes.</span>&mdash;Near the
  base of the Anti-Taurus mountains in the eastern part of the
  province of Konieh is the city of Nigde, which is little known in
  this country as a rug-producing centre, though its fabrics reach
  Europe. Many of them are namazliks, that are distinguished by
  their high geometric arches. The borders often show the influence
  of the Kurdish tribes, and contain patterns common in the
  Mesopotamian valley; but their colour scheme of red, blue, and
  yellow more closely resembles the Anatolian. Most of them are of
  small size and are poorly woven.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Tuzlas.</span>&mdash;Another
  class of Asia Minor rugs rarely seen are the Tuzlas. They are
  generally regarded as Anatolians, but are made by people who live
  about Lake Tuz Gul in the province of Konieh. Some of them are
  well woven, and have soft woollen pile and attractive patterns.
  The prayer arch of the namazliks bears some resemblance to the
  arch of the Kir-Shehrs; the panel is relatively high; and not
  infrequently the borders have rosettes similar to those of
  Bergamos. The principal colours are red, blue, green, and
  ivory.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Kaisariyeh.</span>&mdash;One of
  the few Asia Minor centres for the manufacture of silk textiles
  is the city of Kaisariyeh, the ancient C&aelig;sarea, near the
  eastern part of Anatolia. Formerly rugs of excellent quality were
  made there; but the modern products are, as a rule, inferior both
  in workmanship and material to those of Hereke. Frequently their
  dyes are aniline and the colours garish. Many of them are
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id=
  "Page_191">191</a></span> prayer rugs with arches resembling the
  Ghiordes pattern, but their borders are more conventional.
  Woollen rugs which are copies of other well-known Asia Minor
  pieces are also woven there.</p>

  <p class="center"><i>COLOUR PLATE VII&mdash;LADIK PRAYER
  RUG</i></p>

  <p><i>The rug here represented conforms in every particular to
  one of the best types of Ladik prayer rugs. It contains the
  beautiful border stripe of Rhodian lilies, the pomegranates and
  vandykes in the panel below the central field, and the queer
  designs of scrolls and serrated leaves so peculiar to these rugs.
  It is interesting to see how the pattern of the innermost stripe,
  which consists of a row of S-forms at the top and sides, is
  changed so as to resemble a ribbon at the bottom, to note the
  eight-pointed stars resting on octagons in the lower panel, so
  suggestive of nomads, and also the designs which have been placed
  near the two corners on the left, between the rosettes and
  Rhodian lilies of the main stripe, as if to divert the spell of
  the &ldquo;evil-eye.&rdquo; Such irregularities, denoting the
  idiosyncrasies of the weaver, add to the charm of Oriental
  rugs.</i></p>

  </div>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Yuruks.</span>&mdash;Suggestive
  of gipsies, yet widely unlike them, are the tribes of Turkoman
  descent known as Yuruks. This term means &ldquo;Wanderers;&rdquo;
  and they are well named, since throughout the western part of
  Asia Minor they follow their sheep, cattle, and camels from the
  rich pastures among the mountain tops of the interior, where they
  live in summer, to the fertile, sunny plains bordering the
  seashore in winter. Even near Smyrna and the slopes of Mt.
  Olympus may be seen their black goat&rsquo;s-hair tents, where
  the unexpected guest is always welcome.</p>

  <p>In their rugs is the reflection of their untrammelled lives,
  unaffected by the refinements of cities; and as their lives are
  different from those of all other inhabitants of Asia Minor, so
  are these rugs entirely distinct, resembling more than anything
  else the work of the wild Kazaks of the Caucasus. In them will be
  recognised the same long nap, the same massing of colour, the
  same profusion of latch-hooks, and other simple designs. The
  colours, however, are less brilliant, bright reds and yellows
  being more sparingly used; but on the other hand the depth of
  floccy nap gives a subdued richness to the dark metallic madder,
  blue, green, and brown, such as is rarely seen in any Kazak. The
  patterns show the usual diversity of nomadic rugs. The fields may
  contain crude, unrelated figures, or diagonal stripes on which
  are small geometric designs. Again from the Kurdish tribes to the
  east may be adopted the pear designs as well as floral forms, but
  the drawing is always far from realistic.</p>

  <p>Most of the modern rugs have fine wool coloured with vegetable
  dyes, and stout warp and weft woven to give flexibility; but
  their patterns show a want of all artistic feeling. Now and then,
  however, comes to light a piece that has stood the wear of more
  than a century, showing the touch of a higher craftsmanship, and
  with colours softened by each succeeding year.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally
  brown, red, and blue, with minor quantities of yellow, green, and
  white. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally five to
  seven; perpendicularly, six to nine. The rows of knots are not
  closely pressed down, yet the warp does not show at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, wool or goat&rsquo;s hair; each of the two
  threads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id=
  "Page_192">192</a></span> encircled by a half knot is equally
  prominent at back. <i>Weft</i>, wool of medium diameter. A thread
  of weft crosses two, three, or four times between every two rows
  of knots, varying in the same rug. <i>Pile</i>, wool, clipped
  long. <i>Border</i>, from four to six stripes, occasionally with
  an outer edging. <i>Sides</i>, generally a heavy double
  overcasting, but occasionally a double selvage of two or three
  cords. <i>Lower end</i>, a coloured web through which generally
  runs a parti-coloured cord, and warp loops; or the warp threads
  may be knotted and hang loose. <i>Upper end</i>, a coloured web
  through which generally runs a parti-coloured cord, a braided
  selvage, and a warp fringe; or the warp ends may be braided
  together at short intervals. <i>Texture</i>, loose. <i>Weave</i>
  at back is of moderately coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, four
  to nine feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two fifths to two thirds
  length.</p>

  <h4>ASIA MINOR BORDER STRIPES</h4>

  <p>Regarded as a whole, the borders of Asia Minor rugs show but
  slight relationship to either the geometric patterns of the
  Caucasian, or the floral patterns of the Persian; for as a rule
  the geometric features either are subordinate or suggest an
  origin by degradation from floral designs, and the floral
  features generally are represented by an orderly arrangement of
  disjunct forms rather than by continuous vines with pendent
  flowers. Yet there is no doubt that some were copied by Caucasian
  weavers, and that many were derived from Persian patterns. They
  are frequently, however, more artistic than the former, more
  interesting than the latter, and rival both in beautiful
  colouring and delicate drawing.</p>

  <p><i>Primary Stripes.</i>&mdash;Several different stripes
  peculiar to Ghiordes prayer rugs are illustrated in Plate
  <a href="#pg">G</a>, Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (opp. Page 192). The
  first of these is probably the oldest. It is so strikingly
  suggestive of the Herati design of rosette and attendant leaves
  that there can be little doubt of its Persian origin. The
  seed-like processes of the alternate rosettes are noticeable. The
  second, which is found in many of the Ghiordes rugs, shows the
  same pattern more conventionalised, with the rosette resembling
  an open pod and with the leaves almost octagonal-shaped. The
  third is a still greater evolution of the same pattern in which
  leaves and rosettes of nearly equal shape and size are placed at
  three angles of a quadrangular space. The last, which is a very
  elaborate pattern somewhat similar to the first, is found in a
  few old rugs. Besides these, a number of parallel lines similar
  to those of Kulah rugs (Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 12) are
  sometimes seen in the Ghiordes.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id=
  "Page_193">193</a></span></p>

  <p>One of the best known Ghiordes stripes found in odjaliks and
  sedjadehs is shown in Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 6. It is a
  broad stripe with wide, vine-like bands covered with rows of
  small flecks or flowers. Between each flexure of the band are
  designs probably symbolic of early sun worship.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 7, is represented the most
  usual and beautiful stripe of the Ladik prayer rugs. The
  principal motives are Rhodian lilies, and rosettes identical with
  Persian forms, that are probably conventionalised roses. Another
  stripe, in which the lily is replaced by a conventionalised vine,
  is shown in Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 8. Both these stripes
  are found only in Ladik rugs. Other stripes seen now and then in
  Ladik and Melez sedjadehs are illustrated in Plate <a href=
  "#pg">G</a>, Figs. 9, 10, and 11, each of which shows a
  conventionalised leaf.</p>

  <p>One of the most typical Kulah stripes is seen in Plate
  <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 12. It might in fact be regarded as a
  number of parallel stripes, but as will be evident by observing a
  large series of Kulahs it serves the function of a single broad
  stripe. Often the separate bands are replaced by a ground of
  uniform colour marked by parallel rows of minute flowers of
  regularly varying colour. Occasionally this stripe is copied by
  Ghiordes weavers.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 13, is a well-known stripe
  that appears both in Kulah and Rhodian rugs. As previously
  explained, its origin is probably floral, though the drawing is
  geometric. A formal stripe found in Bergamos, and consisting
  largely of diamonds and eight-pointed stars, is represented in
  Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 14.</p>

  <p>Figs. 15 and 16 of Plate <a href="#pg">G</a> illustrate the
  border stripes of Melez rugs. Each contains regularly spaced
  rosettes, separated by conventionalised leaf forms. A much more
  geometric Melez border, in which the rosettes are replaced by
  eight-pointed stars and the leaves by discs, is shown in
  Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 17.</p>

  <p>A geometric stripe of uncertain origin that is found in some
  Koniehs is shown in Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 18.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Figs. 19 and 20, are represented
  two stripes characteristic of Kir-Shehrs. The former is a dainty
  pattern consisting of a row of bushes separated by the lily
  design. It is occasionally found in the Melez also.</p>

  <p>A typical Mudjar stripe in which the geometric patterns are
  sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id=
  "Page_194">194</a></span>divided into small and richly coloured
  mosaic work is seen in <a href="#pg">Plate G</a>, Fig. 21.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>, Fig. 22, is illustrated a Yuruk
  border stripe such as is frequently seen in modern pieces.</p>

  <p><i>Secondary and Tertiary Stripes.</i>&mdash;In Plate <a href=
  "#ph">H</a>, Figs. 1 and 2 (opp. Page 194), are illustrated two
  secondary stripes frequently seen in Ghiordes and Kulah rugs. The
  first is most suggestive of a running vine, and the second has
  doubtless been derived from it.</p>

  <p>A more ornate pattern, which generally accompanies the broad
  band of perpendicular lines peculiar to Ghiordes and Kulah rugs,
  is shown in Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>, Fig. 3. The arrangement of
  three leaves in angles of quadrangular spaces suggests
  relationship to the primary stripe of Plate <a href="#pg">G</a>,
  Fig. 3 (opp. Page 192).</p>

  <p>Two other secondary stripes found in Ghiordes rugs are seen in
  Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>, Figs. 4 and 5. The former, which is
  also found in Kulahs is a vine and flower subject to many
  modifications.</p>

  <p>A tertiary stripe containing a ribbon-like vine is very usual
  in Ghiordes and Kulah pieces. One of these, which is very
  graceful, is shown in Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>, Fig. 6.</p>

  <p>Another angular vine with pendent flower, that appears as a
  secondary stripe of a large number of Ladik prayer rugs, is
  illustrated in Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>, Fig. 7. This resembles
  a few Persian stripes, but the drawing of the pendent leaf is
  characteristic of Asia Minor.</p>

  <p>Figs. 8 and 9 of Plate <a href="#ph">H</a> represent two
  tertiary stripes often seen in Ladiks and Kulahs. They illustrate
  the evolution of patterns; for in the same stripe of a rug will
  sometimes be seen the first of these and the simple ribbon
  pattern of Plate <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 18 (opp. Page 158),
  and also in the same stripe of another rug will sometimes be seen
  the second of these and a continuous row of
  &ldquo;<i>ff</i>&rdquo; designs, as in Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>,
  Fig. 2.</p>

  <p>The most typical of all Kulah secondary stripes, though it is
  also seen in Rhodian rugs and occasionally in an old Ghiordes, is
  illustrated in Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>, Fig. 10. A somewhat
  similar stripe is shown in Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>, Fig. 11.
  The design looks like a Chinese motive, but that it is evolved
  from a vine will be seen by comparing these stripes with those in
  Figs. 4 and 12. All of them are Asia Minor border stripes.</p>

  <p>In Figs. 13 and 14 of Plate <a href="#ph">H</a> are
  illustrated the swastika and <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>S stripe, which are seen
  now and then in Asia Minor rugs, such as Kulahs, and also in
  Caucasian rugs.</p>

  <p>One of the most typical of Melez secondary stripes,
  representing processes like cogs projecting in a row from
  alternating sides of the stripe, is shown in Plate <a href=
  "#ph">H</a>, Fig. 15. The stripes shown in Figs. 16 and 17 of
  Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>, representing a row of small rosettes
  and a row of octagonal discs, are also occasionally seen in Melez
  rugs.</p>

  <p>The very angular vine shown in Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>, Fig.
  18, is sometimes seen in Koniehs.</p>

  <p>A very unusual secondary stripe (Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>,
  Fig 19), found in a few Anatolians, represents a fret pattern,
  which was probably copied from some monument.</p>

  <p>The chain pattern (Plate <a href="#ph">H</a>, Fig. 20) is
  occasionally seen as a tertiary stripe in the Ghiordes. It
  appeared in Asia Minor rugs of several centuries ago, and has
  been copied by the weavers of Caucasia. Sometimes the lines are
  angular, and again the S&rsquo;s are separated by small round or
  square dots.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

  <h4>CAUCASIAN RUGS</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/a.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="A"
  title="A" /></span>SIDE from the facts that the Caucasus is
  rugged, that during the Middle Ages it was ruled by the
  illustrious Tamara, and that till recently the physical charms of
  its women made them favourites in the slave markets of
  Constantinople, the character and history of that country are
  to-day almost as unknown to the average reader as they were when
  the bards of ancient Greece bound Prometheus to its rocks and
  hung the Golden Fleece from its oaken boughs. Yet it is a country
  of wonderful interest. Above its gorges, rivalling those of the
  Himalayas, rise mountains higher than the Alps. On the
  southwestern slope are combined the luxuriant vegetation of
  tropical lowlands with virgin forests of fir and pine, and in
  meadows and beside shaded brooks grow flowers of strange beauty.
  Beneath the ground is undeveloped wealth of ores and mineral oil.
  The river Phasis is the natural home of the pheasant; the crags
  are the resorts of ibex; and in secluded glens sharing solitude
  with bear, wolf, and boar are hidden the wild aurochs.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the philologist, ethnologist, and historian can here
  follow his favourite pursuit with as much zest as the Alpine
  climber, botanist, mineralogist, and sportsman; for within the
  confines of this region are spoken some seventy languages by as
  many distinct clans, each of remote origin. Some are the
  descendants of the early dwellers; some are the Aryan stock that
  found its way to Europe before the beginning of history; still
  others are but the offspring of the flotsam and jetsam which
  recurring waves of Asiatic conquerors, surging westward in
  ancient times, left stranded here. Nevertheless, for so many
  generations have the present inhabitants remained among their
  mountain strongholds, unabsorbed and unassimilating, that they
  have been regarded as a type sufficiently pure and characteristic
  to give its name to the great Caucasian race.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id=
  "Page_198">198</a></span>Though enjoying greater isolation than
  surrounding countries, the Caucasus at different times and in
  different ways has felt their influences. During the Augustan age
  of Tamara&rsquo;s rule she attracted by her brilliancy, taste,
  and industry foreign courtiers and artisans. Hardly was she dead
  before Genghis Khan&rsquo;s horde of conquering Mongols poured
  over the land; and rival suitors, enraptured by her
  daughter&rsquo;s beauty, pressed their claims by invading it with
  their Mohammedan armies. For long succeeding years Persia
  struggled with Turkey for the mastery of the country, and was
  about to take it when Russia grasped the prize, but only after
  Shamyl with a few brave thousands had defeated vast armies.</p>

  <p>Each of these foreign guests or foes left some impression on
  the native art; so that Caucasian rugs show traces of Turkoman,
  Turkish, and Persian influences. It is rarely, excepting in a few
  small geometric figures, that there is any evidence of the
  Turkoman influence; but it is not unusual to see border stripes
  and field designs adopted from the Turkish rugs. Some of these
  stripes represent both geometric and floral patterns, either
  copied directly or derived with slight modifications from rugs
  woven three or four centuries ago in Asia Minor or Armenia. The
  Persian influence is apparent only in the floral forms. It
  doubtless inspired the stripe of dainty carnations so common in a
  large number of Caucasian pieces, the pear design inseparable
  from Baku rugs, as well as many other figures that first appeared
  in the rugs of Persia.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, these rugs have their own distinct
  characteristics, which have a boldness and virility that are to
  be attributed in a measure to grand and rugged scenery as well as
  to centuries of struggle for independence, since in art the
  influence of environment is most apparent. They lack something of
  the sobriety, artistic drawing, and delicate colouring of those
  woven in vast deserts, amid the monuments of fallen empires, and
  in the gardens of the East; they contain on the other hand, both
  in line and colour, the forceful expression of untrammelled
  thought. The patterns are largely geometric; the tones of colour,
  in which clear red, blue, green, and yellow predominate, are
  strong. On the whole, they possess an individuality of character
  that is not surpassed by the rugs of any other group.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Daghestans.</span>&mdash;In no
  part of Caucasia have better rugs been woven than in Daghestan,
  &ldquo;the mountain country.&rdquo; Nor is it sur<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>prising
  that this province should produce distinctive types, when it is
  considered that it has a length of over two hundred miles; that
  its topography is diversified by glaciated mountains, barren
  steppes, and fertile valleys; and that it is occupied by numerous
  clans, many of whom differ in origin as well as religion. Some of
  the rugs come from the city of Derbend on the Caspian Sea; some
  come from Kuba in the southeastern corner; others, called
  Kabistans, are produced in the country about Kuba; a few are made
  by the Lesghians who live among the lofty mountains; and in other
  parts of the province are woven pieces which formerly were sent
  in large numbers to Europe and America, where they soon became
  known as Daghestans.</p>

  <p>Though their resemblance to the Kabistans is so great that it
  is often difficult to distinguish between them, the rugs which
  acquired the trade name of Daghestans are different from almost
  all other Caucasian pieces. This is largely because the province
  is bounded on three sides by a sea and a nearly impassable
  mountain range, which render communication with surrounding
  territory difficult, and create a natural isolation, where in the
  course of many generations a distinct type was developed.
  Moreover, these same physical conditions have impeded both the
  introduction of aniline dyes, so that even among modern pieces
  spurious colours are not frequently seen; and also the adoption
  of new designs, so that the patterns of two or three centuries
  ago are still largely used.</p>

  <p>It is among the oldest rugs of the Daghestan weave that are
  found many of the best examples of Caucasian textile art. The
  dark, rich reds and blues of the fields, which are brightened by
  the ivory, light blue, green, and yellow of the small designs,
  resemble the fine colouring of choice Persian carpets. But the
  patterns are totally dissimilar; for it is only in a few rare old
  pieces, in which are copied some designs such as the lotus, or
  the running vine with leaf and bud, that there is any likeness to
  the realism of Persian floral ornamentation.</p>

  <p>The drawing, however, is never crude, and on account of the
  short nap and strongly contrasting colours always appears with
  clear definition. With the exception of conventionalised pears,
  the three-leaf sprig, which is commonly seen in the field, and
  the narrow border stripes of carnations, almost all of the
  figures are geometric; and are so carefully drawn, so closely
  clustered, that they represent an appearance frequently compared
  to mosaic work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id=
  "Page_200">200</a></span> Even when the patterns represent large
  medallions or stars, they contain smaller concentric forms, or
  are divided and redivided into smaller stars, diamonds, or
  tessellated figures, so that the effect is the same. In some form
  or other the latch-hook is seen in almost all these pieces. Of
  small designs, the octagonal disc is almost invariably found; and
  animals, human beings, and the pear are not infrequently
  seen.</p>

  <p>As the population of the province is largely Mohammedan,
  namazliks as well as sedjadehs are made; but with the exception
  of the unobtrusive arch of the namazlik, which is represented in
  Plate C, Fig. 9 (Page 61), there is little difference between
  them. There is never any panel as in Asia Minor rugs; nor is
  there a noticeable spandrel, since the space above the arch
  contains designs similar to those on the rest of the field.</p>

  <p>As a rule, the borders consist of three or four stripes
  separated by coloured lines. Only in the secondary stripes are
  any floral forms employed; and these, with the exception of the
  carnation design, are rare. The reciprocal trefoil is most
  characteristic as an outer stripe; the serrated line is also
  employed; and it is not unusual to find next to the field a broad
  stripe of diagonal barber-pole bars, on which are small dotted
  lines.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally blue,
  red, and ivory, with minor quantities of green and yellow.
  <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally seven to
  twelve; perpendicularly, eight to fifteen. A half knot, as it
  appears at back, is as long as wide and occasionally longer. The
  rows of knots are not firmly pressed down, so that their
  alignment is even and the warp shows at back. <i>Warp</i>, wool;
  each of the two threads encircled by a knot is equally prominent
  at the back; occasionally in old pieces one thread is slightly
  depressed below the other. <i>Weft</i>, wool of medium diameter.
  A thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows of knots.
  <i>Pile</i>, wool, clipped short. <i>Border</i>, three to five
  stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a selvage of two, three, or four cords, or
  occasionally a weft-overcasting. <i>Both ends</i>, a web, one row
  of knots or more, and loose warp fringe. Occasionally there is
  also a narrow braided selvage. <i>Texture</i>, moderately firm.
  <i>Weave</i> at back is of fine grain. <i>Usual length</i>, five
  to ten feet. <i>Usual width</i>, one half to two thirds
  length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Kabistans.</span>&mdash;Within
  recent years most of the rugs shipped from the southern part of
  Daghestan have become known in Western <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>markets
  as Kabistans, though the distinction between them and the type
  that takes the name of the province is so slight that it is
  determinable only by the strictest analysis. In fact, Kabistans
  are merely a variety of Daghestans. Both have short nap and
  occasionally adopt the same colour scheme and patterns, so that
  many of each class are indistinguishable from one another.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there are a few interesting points of
  difference between the best types, which are largely attributable
  to geographic environment. As the only easy access to this
  province from the south is by the shore of the Caspian, where the
  great mountain wall that forms an almost impassable barrier
  between Northern and Southern Caucasia descends to the plain, the
  district adjacent to this entrance on the line of travel would
  naturally feel and show a foreign influence, while the remote and
  more inaccessible parts of the province would be unaffected.
  Accordingly, the designs of Kabistans are more varied, and it is
  not surprising to find in them evidences of Persian influence not
  so apparent in the Daghestans. In some, for instance, are pear
  designs, like those occasionally seen in Shiraz pieces; and the
  rich tones, that are usually more subdued than those of the
  Daghestans, suggest the finest dyes of the Feraghans. There is
  also a slight difference in weave. Both display the two threads
  of warp encircled by each knot with equal prominence at the back;
  but in the Daghestans the alignment of the two halves of the
  knot, as they appear at the back, is more regular; while in the
  Kabistans one extends beyond the other in the direction of the
  length of the rug, as is the case with the Shirvans woven in the
  adjoining country to the south. Frequently the weft of Kabistans
  is of cotton; and the filling is not as wide as that of
  Daghestans, which is of wool. Moreover, the Kabistans may be
  either overcast or have a selvage at the sides, but the
  Daghestans have almost always a narrow selvage. Among the modern
  pieces there is a tendency for both classes to follow the side
  finish of the Shirvans.</p>

  <p>A well-known type of old Kabistans, that is also sometimes
  repeated in Daghestans, has a dark blue field on which are spaced
  in regular order white bracket-like designs, in which the
  perpendicular arms are usually connected (Plate <a href=
  "#po">O</a>, Figs. 18-a and 18-b, Page 291). Their origin is
  unknown; but when their shape and their position in reference to
  the rosettes or effulgent stars that are placed near them are
  considered, the thought is at once suggested that in them is
  reproduced after a long process of slow change a

  Other small harmonious designs are properly spaced throughout the
  fields, and in the main stripe of the border, on a cream-coloured
  ground, is frequently seen the beautiful pattern of Cufic origin
  represented in Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, Fig. 19 (opp. Page
  228). Old pieces of this pattern, which are now growing rare,
  represent in weave, colour, and design the masterpieces of
  Caucasian textile art.</p>

  <p>Another pattern consists of diagonal stripes with small
  geometric figures, or of small floral forms arranged in rows, so
  that those of similar colour fall in diagonal lines. Again, the
  entire field may be covered with rectangular pears like those of
  Baku rugs. Oblong odjaliks are often seen with fields of dark
  colour, at each end of which are large geometric figures
  symmetrically balanced with reference to the centre. But they are
  so fringed with latch-hooks and so subdivided into smaller
  devices, which are accentuated by the shortness of the nap, that
  they have the effect of an assemblage of smaller designs.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally blue,
  also some red, ivory, green, and brown. Knot, Ghiordes.
  <i>Knots</i> to inch horizontally seven to twelve;
  perpendicularly, eight to sixteen. A half knot, as it appears at
  back, is as long as wide and occasionally longer. The rows of
  knots are not firmly pressed down; their alignment is less even
  than in Daghestans, yet the warp may be seen at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, wool; each of the two threads encircled by a knot is
  equally prominent at back. <i>Weft</i>, wool or cotton, of medium
  diameter. A thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows
  of knots and occasionally three times. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of
  medium length. <i>Border</i>, three to five stripes.
  <i>Sides</i>, generally a weft-overcasting, or a two-cord weft
  selvage; occasionally a double overcasting or selvage. <i>Lower
  end</i>, a narrow web, not infrequently a fine braided selvage
  and warp loops. <i>Upper end</i>, a narrow web, occasionally a
  fine braided selvage and warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, moderately
  firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of medium grain. <i>Usual
  length</i>, five to twelve feet. <i>Usual width</i>, one half to
  three quarters length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Kubas.</span>&mdash;Not far
  from the southeast corner of the province of Daghestan, in a
  plain watered by streams that debouch from the Caucasus, is the
  small town of Kuba. It is on the site of an old Persian fort,
  about which in the course of time sprang up a town sufficiently
  important to be the residence of a Khan. For a long <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>period
  previous to the treaty of Gulistan, in 1813, the influence of the
  Persians had been predominant in this part of the country; and it
  is not improbable that some of the oldest Kuba rugs now existing
  are the work of their weavers. Many, on the other hand, have few
  foreign characteristics either of weave or design, and show a
  relationship to the work of the Shemakha tribes, who inhabit an
  adjoining district in Shirvan.</p>

  <p>In some of this class the floral form receives more elaborate
  treatment than in any other Caucasian rug. One of the patterns of
  undoubted Iranian inspiration represents a large oval panel or
  medallion, with graceful outlines resting on a field of deep blue
  and sable brown, streaked with waving lines of gold. Within the
  medallion is a lavish display of large flowers <i>en masse</i>,
  and not detached from one another or arranged in set form, as is
  the case with most floral patterns. In each corner is a rose with
  spreading petals that equals the largest seen in nature, and with
  colour that suggests the beauty of a Duchess or Marechal Niel.
  Surrounding all is a narrow dainty border of some well-known
  Persian vine. The most recent copies of this pattern, that has
  been followed for at least a century and a half, are so crude as
  to resemble but slightly the oldest, which suggest the work of
  some early Kirman weaver and are unsurpassed in beauty and
  artistic elegance by any other Caucasian rug.</p>

  <p>Other patterns are more distinctly representative of the
  native art. The field of some is occupied by large, irregular,
  octagonal-shaped figures defined by serrated edges and subdivided
  by mosaic work, at the centre of which is some well-known design.
  One of the most pleasing patterns consists of a field on which
  with mathematical precision are placed large effulgent stars. At
  their centre is often a much smaller star enclosed by a diamond
  from which extend broad rays directed towards the eight principal
  points of the compass. When softened by time the different
  shades, such as light blue, ivory, and deep red of the enveloping
  rays, contrasted with other shades at the centre and with a dark
  blue of the ground, are exceedingly beautiful.</p>

  <p>The Kubas and Shemakhas have similar tones of colour,
  consisting principally of blues, reds, sable brown, and yellow,
  to which the soft, velvety character of the wool of the best
  examples gives a quality of richness that is distinctive. The
  finish of their sides and ends, which is usually similar to that
  of the Soumaks, is also identical, so that they are frequently
  mistaken for one another, and can<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span> only be distinguished by
  a difference of pattern and a slight difference of weave.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally blue,
  red, and brown, occasionally some green. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes.
  Knots to inch horizontally six to nine; perpendicularly, seven to
  thirteen. The rows of knots are pressed down, so that the warp is
  almost hidden at back. <i>Warp</i>, fine wool; the two threads
  encircled by a knot are equally prominent at back. <i>Weft</i>,
  wool of fine or medium diameter. A thread of weft crosses twice
  between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool of medium
  length. <i>Border</i>, one to three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a blue
  double selvage of two or three cords. <i>Both ends</i>, a narrow
  blue web of &ldquo;herring-bone&rdquo; weave, a knotted selvage
  or several rows of knots, and short warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>,
  slightly loose. <i>Weave</i> at back is of moderately fine grain.
  <i>Usual length</i>, four to nine feet. <i>Usual width</i>, one
  half to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Derbends.</span>&mdash;Near the
  great walls built by Alexander on the Caspian Sea, where
  mountains rise abruptly so as to leave only a narrow pass, is one
  of the oldest cities of Caucasia. It was known by the Romans as
  Albana, and was renamed by the Persians of the VI Century
  &ldquo;Derbend,&rdquo; which in their language signifies a
  gateway. No other city of Caucasia has been visited by more
  foreign foes. Tartar tribes passed that way when entering Europe;
  Mongolians captured it as late as the XIII Century; Russians and
  Persians in turn held it. Moreover, the sea has offered an easy
  approach to the Turkoman tribes dwelling to the east. It is
  therefore somewhat surprising that there is so little evidence of
  artistic foreign influence in the weavings; but this is due,
  perhaps, to the fact that pieces with an authentic age of over
  two centuries no longer exist, and such old rugs as remain are
  very scarce; whilst the modern pieces are derived largely from
  the mountainous districts that find a market in the city.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, however, there comes to light a very old piece
  that reaches the standard of the finest Kabistan. The field of
  such a one may be filled with elaborately drawn pears like those
  seen in many of the Niris rugs. Again, it may be covered with a
  checkered or lattice-work pattern that contains within the
  diamonds geometric or semi-floral mosaic designs. Surrounding
  this field are three or four stripes, of which the outer has a
  reciprocal pattern. The nap is of fine wool of moderate length.
  At the back of these older rugs <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>is sometimes displayed
  finely spun reddish dyed threads of woollen weft pressed closely
  together between lines of knots carefully tied to brownish
  threads of woollen warp; but not infrequently cotton is used for
  both warp and weft. Such designs and technique suggest the rugs
  woven much farther to the south.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

  </div>

  <p>In contrast with these beautiful but rare pieces, the modern
  products are sad commentaries on the retrogression in weaving;
  for those that are ordinarily found in the market are like poor
  imitations of inferior Daghestans. They are of slightly larger
  size, and have longer nap, looser weave, and cruder colours.
  Moreover, they show evidences of Turkoman influences; for not
  infrequently the warp is of brown goat&rsquo;s hair, and at each
  end is a reddish brown web like what may be seen in the rugs of
  Yomud tribes living on the eastern shores of the Caspian. Still
  other nomadic characters, resembling the workmanship of Kazak
  tribes, appear in the large star-like or diamond-shaped figures
  which, fringed with latch-hooks and coloured with bright tones of
  red, blue, or green, are often placed in simple array on a field
  of strongly contrasting colour. There is nothing, however,
  offensive in the colour scheme, excepting when aniline dyes are
  used. With wear the nap of many of them acquires the soft and
  pleasing effect of Beluchistans. Furthermore, they are both
  flexible and durable, though entirely lacking in artistic
  qualities.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally blue,
  red, and ivory, with minor quantities of green, yellow, and
  brown. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally five to
  nine; perpendicularly, six to twelve. Each half knot is about as
  long as wide, and occasionally longer. The rows of knots are
  generally pressed down, so that the warp is concealed at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, generally wool, occasionally cotton. The separate
  threads are not strung closely together. Each of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is equally prominent at the back.
  <i>Weft</i>, generally wool, but often cotton. In some pieces a
  thread of weft of medium diameter crosses twice between every two
  rows of knots; not infrequently it crosses both twice and three
  times in the same piece; rarely a thread of coarse diameter
  crosses only once. <i>Pile</i>, wool of medium length.
  <i>Border</i>, three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a double selvage of
  two or three cords, or occasionally a double overcasting. <i>Both
  ends</i> have a web, frequently a knotted selvage, and a warp
  fringe. <i>Texture</i>, moderately loose. <i>Weave</i> at back is
  of medium grain. <i>Usual length</i>, five to seven feet.
  <i>Usual width</i>, one half to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id=
  "Page_206">206</a></span><span class=
  "smcap">Lesghians.</span>&mdash;On the northern flank of the high
  mountain ranges that extend eastward from Kazbek into the
  province of Daghestan, live the numerous tribes classed as
  Lesghians. Their different dialects and languages would indicate
  unrelated origins; but their common religion, mode of life, and
  struggle for liberty have established between all of them strong
  bonds of sympathy. They are nominally Christians, but essentially
  Mohammedans. Most of them live in almost inaccessible spots,
  beneath the snow covered, glaciated ridges, and beside fierce
  flowing torrents, where on occasions they have converted their
  homes into almost impregnable fortresses. These are the people
  who united with the Circassians in the long-continued struggle
  against the Russian Empire, and followed Shamyl to repeated
  victory among the mountain defiles.</p>

  <p>It might naturally be expected that the rugs of such people
  would partake of a character totally distinct from those woven in
  the sunny atmosphere of Kirman, amid the sacred influences of
  Meshed, or among the peaceful hills of Ghiordes. Such, in fact,
  is the case, since both patterns and colouring display extreme
  simplicity, as well as strength and beauty. Large numbers of
  these rugs are of moderate size and slightly oblong; and are
  flexible yet stout. Both warp and weft are of fine brown wool;
  and as is rarely the case with any other Caucasian rugs excepting
  the Shushas, one of the two threads of warp encircled by a knot
  is often almost doubled beneath the other. The knotted fringe of
  the ends suggests the work of tribes living further westward, but
  the selvage of the sides shows relationship to the
  Daghestans.</p>

  <p>The patterns of some of these rugs are not unlike those of
  rugs woven south of the Caucasus; and not infrequently the fields
  contain unrelated designs such as the lozenge fringed with hooks,
  the octagonal disc, eight-pointed stars, and S forms. The borders
  usually consist of two or three stripes, on which is some
  geometric pattern. The colours are few and characteristic. Blue
  and yellow are generally present, and frequently red and brown.
  On the whole, these pieces have an interesting individuality
  unlike that of any other rugs.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, blue, yellow,
  red, brown, and ivory. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch
  horizontally six to nine; perpendicularly, six to eleven. The
  rows of knots are firmly pressed down, so that the warp is almost
  hidden at back. <i>Warp</i>, brown wool;<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span> one of
  the two threads encircled by a knot is depressed below the other
  at back, or doubled under the other. <i>Weft</i>, wool of medium
  diameter. A thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows
  of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool of medium length. <i>Border</i>,
  usually three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, an added selvage, which is
  generally wool but occasionally cotton, of two, three, or four
  cords. Both ends, a web, two or three rows of knots, and a warp
  fringe. In some pieces there is also a braided selvage.
  <i>Texture</i>, firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of slightly coarse
  grain. <i>Usual length</i>, five to eight feet. <i>Usual
  width</i>, one half to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Chichis.</span>&mdash;On the
  lower slope of the Caucasus, extending down into the valley of
  the Terek are the homes of the Tchechens, the weavers of pieces
  so often spoken of as Chichis. Beyond them to the north are great
  stretches of Russian steppes, and to the south is the land of the
  hardy Lesghians. Nevertheless, their rugs show little
  relationship to the work of the latter or of any other tribes to
  the north of the mountain chain; but resemble more closely the
  work of the Shirvans in the valley of the Kur, so that not
  infrequently they are mistaken for them. Indeed, their general
  character is remote from anything barbaric, and is more in
  keeping with the pleasing effect of the Persian sense of harmony.
  All floral forms are conventionalised, but the geometric designs
  have a delicacy of drawing, a refinement of detail, from which
  every jarring note is eliminated.</p>

  <p>Like almost all weavers, the Tchechens adopt different
  patterns. On the field of some of the rugs is a plentiful array
  of small devices surrounding two or three large geometric
  figures; or again the field may be covered with pear designs
  arranged in regular order; but most of the rugs now seen follow a
  common type. In this the field resembles a floor inlaid with
  beautiful mosaic work, formed of carefully cut stones of various
  hues, studiously arranged in the form of small diamonds,
  eight-pointed stars, or rosettes. Not infrequently the rosettes
  are outlined by a fret device surrounding a central star. They
  are invariably arranged in lines parallel to the ends of the
  rugs, and this horizontal effect is sometimes accentuated by
  inserting between each row narrow bands composed of
  conventionalised leaves. The colours of these small designs are
  generally ivory, light blue, pale yellow, or red; and appear more
  pronounced by contrast with the underlying ground of light blue.
  Now and then the nomadic instinct of the Tchechen tribes, who
  lead their flocks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id=
  "Page_208">208</a></span> regularly from the green pastures of
  the ridges to the valley of the Terek, crops out in unrelated
  devices such as combs and S forms, which they weave in the field.
  But they usually arrange them so as to harmonise with the main
  pattern, or else place them near the sides and ends, which are
  almost invariably fringed with either a serrated line or a row of
  reciprocal trefoils projecting from the border into the field.
  This feature of a reciprocal trefoil employed as a fringe to the
  edges of a field independently of the lines of a stripe, is seen
  in very few other classes.</p>

  <p>Often the borders, which contain a large number of stripes,
  are as wide as the central field, with which they harmonise both
  in colour and design. There is something chaste in the simplicity
  of the geometric figures of the secondary stripes and of the
  conventionalised floral drawing of the main stripe. The latter,
  as represented in the type generally seen (Plate <a href=
  "#pi">I</a>, Fig. 6, opp. Page 226), consists of a row of about
  eight rosettes, connected by an angular vine drawn with such
  breadth and regularity as to resemble a number of parallel bars
  diagonal to the sides. In fact, this pattern would be entirely
  geometric were it not for the three-cleft leaves, which spring
  from opposite sides of the rosettes. Of the secondary stripes,
  the outer almost invariably has the reciprocal trefoil, and one
  has frequently a continuous line of eight-pointed stars. The arch
  of the prayer rugs is similar to that of Daghestans.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally
  ivory, blue, and red, with minor quantities of green and brown.
  <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally seven to ten;
  perpendicularly, eight to twelve. The rows of knots are not
  firmly pressed down, so that the warp may be seen at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, wool; each of the two threads encircled by a knot is
  equally prominent at back. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of medium diameter.
  A thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows of knots.
  <i>Pile</i>, wool, of short or medium length. <i>Border</i>,
  three to five stripes. <i>Sides</i>, generally a double
  overcasting, but occasionally a double selvage of two or three
  cords. <i>Both ends</i>, a web, one row of knots or more, and a
  warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, moderately firm. <i>Weave</i> at
  back is of medium grain. <i>Usual length</i>, four and one half
  to six and one half feet. <i>Usual width</i>, five eighths to
  three quarters length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Tcherkess.</span>&mdash;The
  narrow strip of fertile and beautiful country that reaches from
  the Kuban valley southward along the shore of the Black Sea for a
  distance of two hundred miles is occupied by a <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>people
  known to the western world as Circassians. In their own land they
  are called &ldquo;Tcherkesses,&rdquo; a Tartar term for
  &ldquo;cutter of roads&rdquo; or highwaymen; and they have been
  in the habit of speaking of themselves as &ldquo;Adighies&rdquo;
  or Nobles. In fact, there has been no prouder Caucasian race,
  even though their homes were often log huts and their daughters
  were sold in the markets of Constantinople. These are the people,
  who half a century ago finally yielded after a long, fierce
  struggle for independence; but a hundred thousand families,
  preferring exile to submission to the Czar, migrated to Armenia
  and Asia Minor, where they intermarried with other races, and are
  rapidly losing their identity.</p>

  <p>Very few of the Circassian or Tcherkess rugs have been woven
  by those who left their country. The best were made before the
  exodus; and on account of the hardships and poverty of the
  people, many that have come to the market within recent years are
  greatly inferior to the excellent pieces of former times and are
  often mistaken for the work of nomadic tribes. Not only so, but
  crude and foreign devices have crept into some of them. It is,
  therefore, to the older pieces that we must turn for a better
  understanding of this class.</p>

  <p>Something of the ruggedness of lives spent in struggles with
  men and nature found expression in the fabrics, which show
  firmness of texture, boldness of design, richness of colour. In
  fact they resemble the Kazaks so closely in their long nap, and
  finish of sides and ends that they are constantly mistaken for
  them; yet they may be distinguished from all classes by the large
  amount of brownish red or tawny colour of the field and their
  stereotyped patterns. These usually consist of diamond-shaped
  figures sometimes called &ldquo;sun-bursts,&rdquo; that are often
  regarded as crude copies of the Russian coat of arms; but there
  is little doubt that they have been derived from the medallions
  of some old Armenian rugs of the XIV and XV Centuries, in which
  also appear the same tri-cleft leaves so common in both this
  class and the Soumaks. These patterns are sufficiently large to
  occupy the full breadth of the field; and there are seldom less
  than two and occasionally as many as four or five extending from
  one end to the other. The strong contrast between the blue and
  ivory of the figures and the red or tawny colour of the ground is
  softened by the depth of pile, which in turn adds warmth and
  richness. The borders are always of three stripes. The main one
  almost invariably has the tarantula design and is enclosed by
  guards with the serrated sawtooth design. Many of these old
  pieces are ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id=
  "Page_210">210</a></span>cellently woven and have a dignity of
  pattern and wealth of harmonious colour rarely seen in nomadic
  rugs.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red
  and tawny yellow, with minor quantities of blue and white.
  <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally six to nine;
  perpendicularly, seven to ten. A half knot, as it appears at
  back, is as long as wide or longer. The rows of knots are firmly
  pressed down, so that the warp does not show at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, wool; generally each of the two threads encircled by
  a knot is equally prominent at back, occasionally one is
  depressed below the other. <i>Weft</i>, wool of medium diameter.
  A thread of weft usually crosses only twice between every two
  rows of knots, but in some pieces as many as four or six times.
  <i>Pile</i>, wool of medium length. <i>Border</i>, three stripes.
  <i>Sides</i>, a two-cord double selvage. <i>Both ends</i>, as a
  rule have a web, a heavy braided selvage, and knotted warp
  fringe; occasionally either web or selvage may be omitted.
  <i>Texture</i>, very firm. Weave at back of medium grain.
  <i>Usual length</i>, five to ten feet. <i>Usual width</i>, one
  half to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Bakus.</span>&mdash;No other
  rugs of Caucasia have greater individuality of colour and design
  than the Bakus. This, perhaps, is partly due to the fact that the
  district from which they come is dissimilar to any other. It
  consists largely of the peninsula of scanty vegetation, where the
  great mountain chain extends to the dreary Caspian, leaving at
  its base the narrow strip of land now famous for its immense
  accumulations of mineral oil. Hither, during the past, the
  followers of Zoroaster have come from all directions to worship
  in the temple of the Guebres, where day and night the priests
  watched the blue flame that rose perpetually from the ground, and
  once in long intervals spread over the waters like a sea of fire.
  This sacred spot has been owned in turn by Saracens, Persians,
  Turks, Russians, and the Princes of Shirvan; so that the
  influences of different religions and different races have been
  felt here.</p>

  <p>The most noticeable feature of many of these rugs is their
  dull colours, that give the impression of being partly bleached
  or having faded. There are subdued tones of light blue, tan, pale
  ocherous yellow, and black, as well as light, medium, and dark
  brown colours of natural wool; but in the rugs woven a century
  ago the colours were much richer. None of them are used in large
  masses excepting for the underground; nor are there striking
  contrasts, so that the effect is somewhat monotonous.</p>

  <h4><i>COLOUR PLATE VIII&mdash;SOUMAK RUG</i></h4>

  <p><i>The shape, colouring, and particularly the pattern of this
  interesting Soumak, which was probably woven seventy-five or more
  years ago, not only are unusual but belong to a higher type than
  is often seen. Arranged in diagonal rows on a field of red are
  flowering bushes, that for the most part are blue and pink, but
  at one end are green, yellow, and brown. The accurate drawing of
  these bushes and of the reciprocal trefoils of the guard stripes,
  the care with which the stitches have been inserted, and the fine
  texture of the wool, as is shown even in the cream-white warp at
  the knotted ends, alike proclaim the excellent quality of this
  rare piece.</i></p>

  </div>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id=
  "Page_211">211</a></span></p>

  <p>An equally important characteristic is the large number of
  pear designs, which are unlike those of any other rug. These
  designs (Plate <a href="#po">O</a>, Fig. 6b, Page 291) are so
  rectangular that they have lost all resemblance to floral
  drawing; and to add to their formality, each is placed in the
  field with studied regularity and often surrounded by a delicate
  hexagonal shaped sub-pattern giving a diaper effect. Sometimes,
  also, they appear in the border between an array of other
  designs, to which they show no relation; but they never
  constitute the sole feature of the rug as they do in
  Sarabends.</p>

  <p>At the centre of the field is often a star-shaped design
  surrounded by a large diamond or other figure fringed with
  radiating lines. These lines suggest the effulgence of light; and
  it is not improbable that their origin lay in the mysticism of
  fire worship. In sedjadehs the corners are set off by quadrants
  of octagons, of which the diagonal sides are serrated and
  frequently fringed with radiating lines like the central
  medallions. Throughout both corners and fields often appear
  eight-pointed and effulgent stars, the three-cleft leaf, S
  designs, crude human and animal forms, and other small geometric
  devices like those seen in Daghestans and Shirvans. But more
  noticeable than any of these are the realistic but mechanically
  drawn birds, which are represented in larger numbers and more
  frequently than in any other rugs woven within the last
  century.</p>

  <p>The borders contain from three to five stripes, of which one
  at least is always geometric; and another, as a rule, has some
  suggestion of floral form. Often it is only the carnation in
  profile; but now and then it is a running vine with leaf or
  flower, adopted without modification from Persian rugs. This is
  not, however, surprising, when it is remembered that during the
  reign of Shah Abbas, Baku belonged to Persia, which for centuries
  had been the home of devout Parsees, some of whom undoubtedly
  made pilgrimages to the sacred temple.</p>

  <p>These rugs can at once be recognised by their short nap, and
  their characteristic colours and designs. They are always
  interesting on account of their marked individuality and the
  still unsolved symbols of Zoroastrian mysticism they may contain;
  but in spite of the careful delineation of the design and the
  delicate mosaic effect of the central medallions, very few,
  excepting the old pieces, are handsome.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally
  brown, tan, blue, yellow, and black. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots
  to inch horizontally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id=
  "Page_212">212</a></span> six to nine; perpendicularly, seven to
  eleven. The rows of knots are firmly pressed down, so that the
  warp does not show at back. <i>Warp</i>, wool; each of the two
  threads encircled by a knot is generally equally prominent at
  back, occasionally one is depressed slightly below the other.
  <i>Weft</i>, usually cotton, sometimes wool, of medium diameter.
  A thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows of knots.
  <i>Pile</i>, wool, clipped short. <i>Border</i>, three to five
  stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a weft overcasting or a narrow weft
  selvage. <i>Both ends</i>, a web, one row of knots or more, and a
  warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, moderately firm. <i>Weave</i> at
  back is of slightly coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, six to
  nine feet. <i>Usual width</i>, one half to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Shirvans.</span>&mdash;Between
  the rugs of Shirvan and Daghestan is a relationship easily
  accounted for by the fact that they are adjoining provinces, and
  that almost the only approach to Daghestan for the Asiatic races
  among whom the art of weaving reached its highest development was
  through Shirvan. Both districts, therefore, received ideas from
  the same sources; but since Shirvan has been at times more
  completely under the sway of Persia, it has yielded more readily
  to the influence of the Persian weavers, as is observable in the
  flower and foliate forms which are used more frequently and are
  drawn more realistically in its rugs than in those of Daghestan.
  On the other hand, the technique of weave as well as finish of
  sides and ends in the Shirvans lacks something of the refinement
  observable in the Daghestans.</p>

  <p>The oldest existing Shirvans are absorbingly interesting. In
  them the foliate forms are more noticeable than in almost any
  other Caucasian rugs, though they may in a measure be disguised
  by formal treatment. Sometimes they appear as large figures
  covering a great part of the field and acting as sub-patterns for
  superimposed smaller devices; but they are most frequently found
  in the borders. Other old pieces contain lattice-work of
  hexagonal-shaped diaper patterns, within which may be designs
  abounding in latch-hooks and figures strongly suggestive of
  Chinese devices. Such patterns, however, are unusual; as the
  fields of most old Shirvans are covered with large medallions,
  stars, and diamonds similar to those of Daghestans, although the
  drawing inclines to greater simplicity of outline and detail; and
  they have greater diversity of colour, as tones of blue, red,
  green, and brown in a field of ivory are not unusual.</p>

    Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id=
  "Page_213">213</a></span></p>

  <p>The patterns of the more modern rugs have become corrupted
  into a mere mechanical copying of conventional forms lacking all
  artistic spirit. Some of them resemble those found in both
  Daghestans and Kabistans, but generally the designs are drawn
  less clearly in Shirvans. This is partly because, as a rule, they
  are not so closely woven and the nap is not quite so short. Now
  and then the large medallions so common to Soumaks are seen; and
  not infrequently the field is covered with diagonal parallel
  stripes on which are small geometric devices.</p>

  <p>There is, however, one pattern peculiar to Shirvans that
  rarely, if ever, is adopted in any other class. It has somewhat
  the appearance of pole medallions and consists of a panel that
  occupies nearly the whole field and contains broad incisions at
  each side, which nearly divide it into three or four rectangular
  sections. Within each of them are octagonal figures, and an
  octagonal shape is given to both ends of the panel so as to leave
  small corners to the field. Each part often contains small
  designs such as latch-hooks, octagonal discs, S forms,
  eight-pointed stars, and combs, as well as crudely drawn dogs and
  other animal or human forms. With slight modifications this
  pattern is sometimes repeated in the prayer rugs (Plate <a href=
  "#pc">C</a>, Fig. 11, Page 61), but the section at one end is
  more completely an octagon, and the remainder is an oblong
  rectangle. A more usual pattern for prayer rugs has the same form
  of arch that is common in Daghestans.</p>

  <p>Whatever the fields of these rugs may lack in delicacy of
  drawing is amply compensated for by the diversity and beauty of
  some of their borders, which have a well balanced harmony of
  colours. They have seldom less than three, nor more than five
  stripes, of which the secondary are often as interesting as the
  primary. The best known is the one with serrated leaf and wine
  glass, represented in Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig. 1, opp.
  Page 226, which is found in such a large percentage of Shirvans
  that it is almost typical of them. If the figures of the field
  contain latch-hooks, they are very apt to be expressed in some
  form in the primary stripe. Such a one appears in Plate <a href=
  "#pi">I</a>, Fig. 2; and the beautiful Georgian pattern (Plate
  <a href="#pj">J</a>, Fig. 9, opp. Page 228) is also occasionally
  seen. A very much rarer stripe, which is shown in Plate <a href=
  "#pj">J</a>, Fig. 8, is only used when the field has a large
  central panel with a corresponding pattern. Now and then appears
  a stripe with no other ornamentation than a formal row of pear
  designs. Of the secondary stripes, the one with the designs of
  carna<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id=
  "Page_214">214</a></span>tions (Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>, Fig.
  1, opp. Page 230) is very frequently seen, but its beauty depends
  largely upon the delicacy of its drawing and colour scheme. On
  the whole, the Shirvan dyer displays a wider scope in the
  selection of colours than his Daghestan neighbour, but the tones
  are not always so rich or harmonious.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally blue,
  red, and ivory. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally
  seven to twelve; perpendicularly, eight to twelve. The rows of
  knots are firmly pressed down, so that the transverse warp does
  not show at back. <i>Warp</i>, wool; each of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back. <i>Weft</i>,
  generally wool, occasionally cotton, of medium or coarse
  diameter. A thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows
  of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of short or medium length.
  <i>Border</i>, three to five stripes. <i>Sides</i>, generally a

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Soumaks.</span>&mdash;Seventy
  miles to the northwest of Baku, and about the same distance to
  the south of Kuba, where the high ranges of the Caucasus begin to
  descend to the sea, is the city of Shemakha. It was almost
  destroyed by Nadir Shah, but recovered sufficiently within the
  last century to become the capital of Shirvan and a manufacturing
  centre of silks. It is the market place for many tribes from the
  mountains of Daghestan and the valley of the Kur, who take
  thither their rugs, from which its own weavers often borrow
  patterns. By a corruption of the name of the city, their fabrics
  are called Soumaks, though they are more popularly known as
  Kashmirs, because ends of yarn hang loosely at the back, as is
  the case with the beautiful shawls of the noted valley of
  India.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It is, of course, the finish at the back and the absence of
  pile that make them so different from all other rugs and place
  them in a class by themselves; but even apart from these
  characteristics, they are as distinct a type as any in Caucasia.
  On the fields of most of them are three or four diamond-shaped
  medallions, that occupy nearly the full width of the field and
  extend from one end to the other. Almost without exception they
  are slightly hexagonal, and are incised on the diagonal sides to
  represent crosses. These patterns are doubtless derived from very
  old Armenian rugs; and it is possible <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>that
  once the crosses had a religious significance, as it is claimed
  that the earlier weavers of this type were a Christian sect; but
  the present weavers are mostly Mohammedans. At the centre of the
  medallions and in the triangular spaces at the sides are
  flattened octagons, which are generally ornamented with some
  star-shaped devices. Superimposed on these larger patterns and
  surrounding them on the field, are also many small designs, which
  as a rule are grouped with a regularity suggestive of the mosaic.
  Some are common to other Caucasian pieces; but a few are more
  frequently seen in this class than in any other, as for instance,
  the knot of destiny (Plate <a href="#po">O</a>, Fig. 17, Page
  291), and the tri-cleft leaf, drawn like a bird&rsquo;s claw,
  which appeared in Armenian rugs at least five centuries ago.
  Sometimes the medallions and octagons are replaced by smaller and
  more ornate figures, but the geometric character is seldom
  entirely lost.</p>

  <p>There are also some old pieces with a totally different
  pattern, and with fine colours that are most pleasing in the rich
  harmony of tones. They may contain geometric, foliate, or floral
  designs. One recently examined had a field of rose red completely
  covered with diagonal rows of innumerable dainty figures, which
  were evidently the conventionalised forms of small flower bushes.
  Not a single other design appeared in the field, yet the richness
  of colour and chasteness of pattern made it exceedingly
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>The patterns of the border stripes, that number from two to
  five, are generally distinctive; though occasionally they follow
  well known Caucasian drawing. The outer one has so frequently the
  running latch-hook that it is almost typical. As a rule, it has
  the simple form shown in Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>, Fig. 20 (opp.
  Page 230); but now and then the more elaborate drawing of the
  Georgian stripe (Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, Fig. 9, opp. Page
  228) is followed. Sometimes this is replaced by the reciprocal
  trefoil, which is used also for the inner stripe; and a running
  vine and rosette, such as the one in Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>,
  Fig. 4, is not infrequently used for a secondary stripe. The
  primary stripes, on the other hand, although most dissimilar to
  those of other rugs, differ so widely among themselves, that no
  one is typical. Separating these primary and secondary parts of
  the border are frequently narrow lines with the barber-pole
  device.</p>

  <p>The old pieces are of fine texture and excellent wool, which
  even in the warp displays a silky character. The dyes are
  faultless, though the colours never acquire a lustre. Red and
  blue are largely em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id=
  "Page_216">216</a></span>ployed, but they are partly replaced by
  brown in the more modern pieces; and in both old and modern is
  usually an orange yellow that rarely appears in other Caucasian
  rugs.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  blue, brown, some yellow, and white. <i>Knot</i>, flat stitch.
  Knots to inch horizontally eight to fourteen; perpendicularly,
  six to sixteen. <i>Warp</i>, wool; each thread is equally
  prominent at the back. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of fine or medium
  diameter. A thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows
  of knots in old rugs, and between every second and third row in
  modern rugs. <i>Border</i>, two to five stripes. <i>Sides</i>,
  generally a double selvage of several cords, occasionally an
  overcasting. <i>Both ends</i>, narrow web, one or more rows of
  knots and fringe; sometimes heavy added selvage. <i>No nap.</i>
  <i>Usual length</i>, five and one half to twelve feet. <i>Usual
  width</i>, one half to three quarters length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Shemakhas.</span>&mdash;Flatly
  woven Soumaks are not the only rugs of the Shemakha tribes. Some
  of the same people, who dwell among the ranges of the Caucasus a
  short distance to the north, make rugs of pile that occasionally
  surpass in quality of material and beauty of colour scheme the
  best of Daghestans, and are sometimes spoken of by dealers as
  &ldquo;Royal Daghestans;&rdquo; yet they are seldom seen and
  little known. In fact, they are frequently mistaken for Persian
  fabrics on account of the subdued richness of their deep reds,
  blues, greens, yellows, and browns, and the patterns which are
  largely floral.</p>

  <p>Very often the principal border stripe is the well-known
  Georgian pattern, that occurs in so many Soumaks, even though the
  secondary stripe be some Persian pattern. These rugs also
  resemble the Soumaks in the coloured woollen selvage of the
  sides, and in the narrow coloured web of
  &ldquo;herring-bone&rdquo; weave and knotted fringe of the ends.
  In some, the field is divided by diagonal bars into large
  diamond-shaped figures containing conventionalised flowers; in
  others, it is merely a background over which are strewn more
  realistically drawn floral forms; and in all is expressed an
  artistic perception of design and colour not frequently found in
  Caucasian pieces.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally blue,
  red, and brown. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally
  seven to eleven; perpendicularly, seven to thirteen. The rows of
  knots are pressed down, so that the warp is almost hidden.
  <i>Warp</i>, wool; one of the two threads encircled by a knot is
  depressed below the other at back.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span> <i>Weft</i>, wool, of
  fine or medium diameter. A thread of weft crosses twice between
  every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium length.
  <i>Border</i>, two to three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a blue selvage
  of two or three cords. <i>Both ends</i>, a narrow blue web of
  &ldquo;herring-bone&rdquo; weave, a knotted selvage or several
  rows of knots, and short warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, slightly
  firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of moderately fine grain. <i>Usual
  length</i>, four to eight feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two fifths to
  two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Tiflis.</span>&mdash;When it is
  considered that for centuries Tiflis has been the Georgian
  capital, where culture and art received more encouragement than
  in the provinces; that it was in constant communication with the
  rug-producing countries on all sides; and was on one of the great
  highways between Persia and Europe, it is surprising that what
  has been written hitherto about Caucasian rugs has contained
  almost no reference to a type peculiar to this city and district.
  This is undoubtedly due to the fact that within recent years
  hardly any rugs have been produced there, and that the old pieces
  are few and but little known.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, now and then come to light beautiful old rugs
  which are dissimilar to those of all other classes. The wool of
  their moderately long nap has a silkiness that suggests a Shiraz
  or a Meshed; the colour scheme includes a very wide range of
  bright and positive tones, such as blue, green, rose, and ivory;
  the weave of delicate and fine threads is as close as that of old
  Bergamos. A glance at the ends and back helps to determine the
  type; for the warp is occasionally of cotton, which is a
  peculiarity not seen in many other Caucasian classes; the weft
  which crosses from three to five times is of very finely spun
  wool mostly dyed a brown or dull red, and strung with great
  exactness; and the knots are tied with care. There is also
  something distinctive in many of the patterns; for however
  interesting they may be, precision of drawing is often combined
  with discordance of detail. One part of the field, for instance,
  may consist of a well executed diaper pattern; another part may
  represent a number of stiff, perpendicular, parallel bars,
  occupying the full width of the field; and still another part may
  be entirely occupied by hexagonal-shaped pear designs. Adjoining
  these may be other pear designs of totally dissimilar shape as
  well as mystic symbols and other strange devices. Likewise, many
  different colours may be placed in close relation, yet the wool
  is so soft and the tones so delicate that the effect is not
  harsh. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id=
  "Page_218">218</a></span> sort of tree-form is not unusual; but
  on the whole, the designs of both field and border are
  geometric.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally blue
  and red, with minor quantities of yellow, green, and brown.
  <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally six to ten;
  perpendicularly, six to ten. A half knot, as it appears at back,
  is as long as wide or longer. The rows of knots are firmly
  pressed down, so that the warp does not show at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, generally wool, occasionally cotton; each of the two
  threads encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back.
  <i>Weft</i>, wool, of fine diameter, usually dyed red or brown. A
  thread of weft crosses from three to five times between every two
  rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, soft wool of medium length.
  <i>Border</i>, three to five stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a double
  overcasting or narrow selvage. <i>Both ends</i>, a web and warp
  fringe. <i>Texture</i>, firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of
  moderately fine grain. <i>Usual length</i>, six to eleven feet.
  <i>Usual width</i>, three eighths to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Kutais.</span>&mdash;Among a
  large assortment of Caucasian rugs are occasionally seen a few
  pieces from Kutais, once famed as the home of Media, and now the
  capital of Imeritia. The gardens surrounding its homes, that line
  both banks of the river Rion, are fragrant with lilacs and roses;
  in the valley beyond the city, pink rhododendrons and yellow
  azaleas blossom beneath the oaks. Here is woodland scenery not
  found in other parts of Caucasia, and it might be expected that
  the weavings of the people would have a striking individuality of
  their own; but they are little known as a distinct class. In
  fact, they bear such a resemblance to the Kazaks that they are
  constantly mistaken for them; though as a rule they have a more
  oblong shape and somewhat shorter nap; they are less stoutly
  woven, less barbaric, and contain fewer crude, nomadic devices.
  Moreover, as this district was producing rugs before the Cossacks
  had settled permanently in Southern Caucasia, it is not
  improbable that some of its patterns were copied by them.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 50. Gengha
    Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>A peculiarity of this class is the drawing of the pear
  designs, which are found in a very large number of the rugs. The
  extension of the narrower end, instead of being a short, curved
  hook, is generally more developed, so that it may be as long as
  the major axis of the pear and frequently stands almost at right
  angles to it. Also attached to the sides of the pear are
  rectangular bead-like processes (Plate <a href="#po">O</a>, Fig.
  6c, Page 291). In many of these rugs, the field is di<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>vided
  into a number of bands parallel with the sides; and through them
  run vines, from which the pears are suspended. Or the pears may
  be arranged in regular order on the field without the bands and
  vines. Sometimes the field is reduced to a very small space by a
  broad border consisting of a number of stripes, some of which are
  often of striking patterns. One of them is represented in Plate
  <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig. 15 (opp. Page 226), which suggests the
  grape vine common to the gardens of Kutais. Some form of the tree
  of life and floral forms are also seen in old pieces.</p>

  <p>A resemblance exists between the weave of Kutais and Tiflis
  rugs, as in each the weft usually crosses several times; it is
  generally coloured blue or red, and is formed of fine threads of
  yarn. The wool of the nap is of the same fine quality; but the
  warp of the Kutais rugs, which is almost invariably of wool,
  frequently consists of a brown and white thread twisted together;
  and the knots are tied less evenly, so that the alignment at the
  back is a little more irregular, yet less so than in Kazaks.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  blue, and white, with minor quantities of yellow, brown, and
  black. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally five to
  nine; perpendicularly, six to eleven. A half knot, as it appears
  at back, is as long as wide or longer. The rows of knots are
  slightly pressed down. The alignment is more even than in Kazaks.
  <i>Warp</i>, generally wool, occasionally cotton; each of the two
  threads encircled by a knot is equally prominent at the back.
  <i>Weft</i>, wool, of fine or medium diameter. A thread of weft
  usually crosses three times, occasionally only once, and again
  four or five times. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium length or long.
  <i>Border</i>, three to five stripes. <i>Sides</i>, either a
  double overcasting, or a double selvage of two or three cords.
  <i>Both ends</i>, a web and warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>,
  moderately firm. <i>Weave</i> at back, generally of medium fine
  grain but occasionally coarse. <i>Usual length</i>, six to twelve
  feet. <i>Usual width</i>, one third to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Kazaks.</span>&mdash;Of the
  warlike Cossack tribes, which were once stationed along the
  southeastern border of Russia to protect it from the depradations
  of Caucasians, a number settled permanently in Circassia, and a
  few crossed the mountains to the high plateau lying between Lake
  Gotcha and Mt. Ararat. Here they adopted more sedentary lives;
  but there still lingers the inherited spirit that generations ago
  won for them the name Kazaks, which denotes<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span> to the
  Tartars, from whom many have doubtless sprung, a Marauder. All of
  these tribes weave; but the rugs seen in this country come
  principally from the southern district, where may also be found
  the fabrics of other races such as Armenians, Tartars, and the
  native people. Nevertheless, the Kazak weavings are of a most
  distinct type, to which even the smaller Kazakjes conform. They
  have bright, rich colours, of which a liberal amount of green is
  almost invariably present, though sparingly used in other
  Caucasian rugs. Only the Tcherkess vie with them in the length of
  the nap; and no other class has such noticeable patterns of
  incongruous sizes and shapes. They have, in fact, the most
  nomadic, unconventional patterns of all this northern group; and
  in their barbaric characteristics, they bear much the same
  relation to other Caucasian rugs as those of Western Kurdish and
  Yuruk tribes bear to Persian and Asia Minor pieces.</p>

  <p>In marked contrast to the almost mosaic drawing of Chichis and
  many Daghestans, the Kazaks show a tribal fondness for large
  patterns. Sometimes the field is divided into three horizontal
  panels, which may be entirely plain except for a simple design
  fringing the edges; or as is more frequently the case, it may be
  occupied by large, slightly elongated octagons, within which are
  represented smaller figures. Occupying almost the entire field of
  other pieces are large patterns like medallions, perfectly
  balanced with reference to the centre and subdivided into small
  sections, each of which contains individual motives. A few of
  this class, also, have the &ldquo;sunburst&rdquo; pattern, so
  characteristic of the Tcherkess.</p>

  <p>At least half the pieces now seen are without any formal
  pattern, but contain a heterogeneous lot of geometric designs
  characteristic of nomadic weavings; but even these are generally
  arranged with the idea of symmetrical balance. For instance, at
  the centre may be a large geometric figure surrounded at equal
  distances by pairs of smaller and similar figures. Not
  infrequently the drawing of the upper and lower half, or of the
  right and left side, shows an almost perfect correspondence,
  notwithstanding the many separate designs. The most common of
  these are eight-pointed stars, lozenges fringed with latch-hooks,
  and what are known as the &ldquo;tarantula&rdquo; device. Of the
  innumerable small figures, the octagonal discs and S forms are
  the most common; crude animal and human figures are also
  seen.</p>

  <p>Excepting the addition of the arch, there is little
  distinction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id=
  "Page_221">221</a></span> between namazliks and sedjadehs. It is
  small and less graceful than that of Asia Minor pieces, and
  follows stiff lines in harmony with the general pattern. It is,
  however, drawn in two different ways. Generally it has the shape
  of half an octagon, or of a wall-tent with apex flattened; but
  not infrequently it is square or slightly oblong. The narrow
  bands that form the arch are extended transversely from each side
  of the base to the borders; and occasionally they are continued
  down the sides of the field to form at the bottom a figure
  similar to the square-shaped arch. Now and then a comb, or small
  figure of diamond shape, on which to place the bit of sacred
  earth from Mecca, is outlined within the mihrab; and now and then
  crude palm-like figures, indicating where the hands are to be
  rested in the act of devotion, are represented at the sides.</p>

  <p>However many stripes the border may contain, rarely are there
  more than one of any consequence; since the guard stripes have
  generally only the reciprocal sawtooth or trefoil patterns, the
  barber-pole or dotted lines. The absence of important secondary
  stripes, however, brings out more prominently the drawing and
  colouring of the main one. The most common pattern is what is
  known as the &ldquo;tarantula&rdquo; represented in Plate
  <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig. 8 (opp. Page 226). Very similar is the
  crab pattern (Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig. 7), which was
  undoubtedly derived from the double vine of some Persian rug, as
  the crab-like figure may be resolved into a rosette to which are
  attached four conventionalised leaves. Another pattern, which is
  also seen in Kutais rugs, is the crude but striking vine shown in
  Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig. 15, which, when represented in
  bold, rich colours on an ivory field, makes a most effective and
  beautiful border stripe. Other border stripes frequently employed
  in these rugs appear in Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, during recent years, many inferior rugs of
  other tribes have been sold as Kazaks, which in a measure they
  often resemble though they lack their spirit and character. The
  very modern Kazaks, also, are often of poor quality, but those
  made two generations or more ago were carefully and stoutly
  woven, with silky wool dyed with the best of vegetable colours.
  There is always something interestingly barbaric in their long,
  almost shaggy nap, their masses of rich red and green, their bold
  designs surrounded by smaller nomadic figures, all of which
  collectively find no counterpart in any other Caucasian rugs.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  green, and yellow, also some blue, white, and brown. <i>Knot</i>,
  Ghiordes. Knots to inch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222"
  id="Page_222">222</a></span> horizontally six to nine;
  perpendicularly, seven to ten. The rows of knots are pressed
  down, so that the warp is hidden at back. <i>Warp</i>, wool; each
  of the two threads encircled by a knot is equally prominent at
  back. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of coarse diameter, usually dyed red or
  brown. A thread of weft generally crosses only twice between
  every two rows of knots, but occasionally three or four times.
  <i>Pile</i>, wool, clipped long. <i>Border</i>, three to five
  stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a double overcasting attached in
  figure-eight fashion to the sides, or a double selvage having
  from three to five cords. <i>Lower end</i>, a red or brown web
  and warp loops, or a braided selvage and fringe. <i>Upper
  end</i>, a red or brown web, occasionally a braided selvage or
  several rows of knots, and a warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, stout.
  <i>Weave</i> at back is of very coarse grain. <i>Usual
  length</i>, five to twelve feet. <i>Usual width</i>, one third to
  three quarters length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Karabaghs.</span>&mdash;To the
  southeast of Lake Gotcha and north of the river Aras, that
  divides Caucasia from Persia, is the district of Karabagh, a name
  signifying &ldquo;Black Vineyard.&rdquo; On account of its
  geographic position, it has been subject to the Shahs for long
  periods, during the many struggles between the two countries. It
  is, moreover, separated from the rug-producing district of
  Karadagh by the river only; and its southern border is less than
  eighty miles distant from the city of Tabriz, to which many of
  its rugs are taken. For these reasons it would be only natural to
  expect that the weavings of Karabagh would show more of the
  Persian influence than those of any other part of Caucasia. Such,
  indeed, is true, when applied to the oldest pieces; but it is not
  at all true in the case of a large percentage of the modern
  products.</p>

  <p>Within recent years large numbers of these coarsely made and
  wretchedly dyed rugs have reached the Western markets. Some of
  them resemble Kazaks in their geometric figures; but differ from
  them in their workmanship, since one of the two threads encircled
  by a knot is depressed; they are much more loosely woven; they
  are not so large; nor for the most part are they so heavy. Other
  pieces often lack the symbolic and other small designs that
  render nomadic rugs so interesting. Occasionally the central
  field is almost figureless, or there may be large expanses of
  white or some raw colour such as startling red, yellow, or blue,
  on which appear stiffly and crudely drawn nondescript
  devices.</p>

  <p>It is a relief to turn from these poor pieces to those woven
  half <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id=
  "Page_223">223</a></span>a century ago, with less obtrusive
  colouring and more chaste patterns. Many of the old pieces are
  oblong sedjadehs, which have often a length almost twice the
  breadth; though the more modern pieces incline to smaller and
  nearly square sizes. There are also namazliks that do not always
  religiously follow the usual pattern; for now and then one is
  seen with an arch of several steps, rising from near the middle
  of the sides, and with a diamond for the sacred earth or pebble
  from Mecca, as is shown in Plate <a href="#pc">C</a>, Fig. 12
  (Page 61). The particular piece from which this was drawn was
  over fifty years old and was three fourths as wide as long.
  Scattered over the main field, which was yellowish brown, and the
  spandrels, which were white, were geometrically shaped flowers
  with long angular stems tinted with blue, green, and pinkish
  red.</p>

  <p>The borders show as great diversity as the fields, but one
  stripe usually contains a concession to the Persian and another
  to the Caucasian tradition. For instance, the primary stripe may
  be of Iranian character flanked by the running latch-hook; or it
  may be the well-known crab pattern, while the adjacent stripe may
  be a running vine of simple form.</p>

  <p>Many of these old pieces are very handsome and equal in
  artistic finish the best of Caucasian rugs; the drawing is
  carefully executed; the colours are rich; the weave is fair; but
  like the rare old rugs of Daghestan and Tiflis, are now seldom
  seen.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  blue, yellow, and white. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch
  horizontally six to ten; perpendicularly, seven to ten. The rows
  of knots are only slightly pressed down, yet the warp is
  generally concealed at back. <i>Warp</i>, wool; one of the two
  threads encircled by a half knot is depressed below the other at
  back. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of medium or coarse diameter, sometimes
  dyed red. A thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows
  of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of short or medium length.
  <i>Border</i>, three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, generally a double
  selvage of two or three cords, in lengths of different colours;
  occasionally a double overcasting attached figure-eight fashion.
  <i>Lower end</i>, a web and warp loops, or a braided selvage, one

  "smcap">Shushas.</span>&mdash;About seventy miles to the
  southeast of Lake Gotcha is Shusha, capital of Karabagh. Nearly
  two centuries ago, it was built by Nadir Shah on an almost
  inaccessible mountain side to guard the northern boundary of
  Persia, which had been extended to the Caucasus. It has now about
  twelve thousand inhabitants, and is the market place for numerous
  tribes that are scattered over the dry plains as far as the Aras
  river. In this city and in the suburbs are woven rugs that are
  frequently imported to this country and sold under several names,
  yet are of a distinct type. They resemble the Karabaghs of the
  surrounding country but differ from them in their richer and more
  subdued colours as well as in the stoutness of weave. One thread
  of warp to each knot is doubled beneath the other, whereas in the
  rugs of the desert tribes it is only depressed.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dark
  blue, red, and brown, with minor quantities of green and yellow.
  <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally seven to
  twelve; perpendicularly, six to eleven. The rows of knots are
  only slightly pressed down, so that the warp shows at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, wool; one of the two threads encircled by a knot is
  much depressed below the other at back, and frequently doubled
  under the other. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of medium diameter, generally
  dyed red. A thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows
  of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool of medium length. <i>Border</i>,
  three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a double selvage of two or three
  cords, often attached to the sides in figure-eight fashion.
  <i>Lower end</i>, a narrow web and warp loops. <i>Upper end</i>,
  a web that is sometimes turned back and hemmed, and a warp
  fringe. <i>Texture</i>, moderately firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is
  of slightly coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>, four to nine feet.

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Genghas.</span>&mdash;Over the
  land lying between lakes Gotcha, Van, and Urumiah, in Caucasia,
  Armenia, and Persia, tribes of mixed origin wander back and
  forth, but frequently gather at the yearly fair of Elizabethpol.
  During the period when the Persian rule extended over the
  country, it was the residence of a Khan and an important centre
  of trade. As it was then known as Ganja or Gengha, the weavings
  of these nomads, which were marketed there, acquired that
  name.</p>

  <p>Naturally they are a heterogeneous lot containing ideas
  incorporated from many sources; but they resemble the Kazaks more
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id=
  "Page_225">225</a></span>than anything else, and are frequently
  mistaken for them. Yet some of the distinctions are very marked:
  they have a more oblong shape; the nap is shorter; and they are
  less stoutly woven. In the Kazaks a thread of weft, as a rule,
  crosses only twice between two rows of knots, which are firmly
  pressed down; but in these rugs a thread of weft crosses from
  four to eight times between two rows of knots, which are not
  firmly pressed down, so that the narrow filling of weft is
  sometimes even four times as wide as a row of knots and presents
  a bead-like appearance. In the colour scheme of numerous pieces,
  which in many respects resembles that of Karabaghs, is often a
  preponderance of ivory white. There is no characteristic pattern.
  The field may be covered with diagonal stripes as in some
  Shirvans; it may consist largely of lozenges fringed with
  latch-hooks and tarantula devices; again, it may have some large
  central figure surrounded by a motley lot of emblematic as well
  as apparently meaningless devices, or crudely drawn human,
  animal, or floral forms. The borders, likewise, include a wide
  scope of patterns. It is, therefore, largely by the character of
  the weave, quality of material, and finish of sides and ends,
  that these pieces can be distinguished from other nomadic
  products.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally blue,
  red, and white, with minor quantities of green, yellow, and
  brown. <i>Knot</i>, Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally six to
  eight; perpendicularly, six to nine. A half knot, as it appears
  at back, is longer than wide. The rows of knots are not firmly
  pressed down, so that the warp shows at the back. <i>Warp</i>,
  generally wool, occasionally goat&rsquo;s hair; each of the two
  threads encircled by a knot is equally prominent at the back.
  <i>Weft</i>, wool, of medium diameter and usually dyed red. A
  thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows of knots, but
  generally three and frequently as many as six or eight times.
  <i>Pile</i>, wool of medium length. <i>Border</i>, three or four
  stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a double selvage of two, three, or four
  cords. <i>Lower end</i>, a web, usually coloured red, and warp
  loops. <i>Upper end</i>, a web to which a braided selvage is
  often added, and a warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, very loose.
  <i>Weave</i> at back is of coarse grain. <i>Usual length</i>,
  five to nine feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two fifths to two thirds
  length.</p>

  <h4>BORDER STRIPES</h4>

  <p>Disregarding a very few floral secondary stripes that have
  been derived from Persian rugs, the Caucasian borders are
  characterised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id=
  "Page_226">226</a></span> by geometric patterns, which
  distinguish them from other groups. But were it possible to trace
  them to their origin, it would doubtless be found that a very
  large number that are now strictly geometric have degenerated
  from leaf and flower patterns. Of the remainder, some are
  symbolic and others are crude copies of familiar objects. The
  more artistic and realistically drawn floral patterns appear in
  the less conspicuous secondary stripes; but on the other hand the
  primary stripes contain a number of unusually interesting
  patterns, which have been copied for centuries.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Primary
  Stripes.</span>&mdash;The cup and serrated leaf pattern (Plate
  <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig. 1, opp. Page 226) appears so frequently
  in Shirvans as to be almost typical. It is also occasionally seen
  in Daghestans and Kabistans; but probably originated in Southern
  Caucasia or Armenia, since it is found similarly drawn in rugs
  woven in that district about 1500 <span class="smcap">a.
  d.</span> It is a pattern that scarcely varies with time or
  locality except in the number of serrations to the leaf and in
  the shape of the cup.</p>

  <p>Serrated leaf patterns, represented in Figs. 2 and 3, Plate
  <a href="#pi">I</a>, are sometimes seen in Kazak and other
  nomadic rugs. It is not improbable that they have a common origin
  with the Shirvan cup and leaf pattern.</p>

  <p>In the stripe represented in Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig.
  4, is a series of wine cup rosettes that are occasionally seen in
  the old rugs from the Shirvan district. In fact, the wine cup
  design is a favourite there.</p>

  <p>Another stripe, in which a somewhat similar cup appears, is
  shown in Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig. 5. This is an old
  nomadic pattern not frequently seen.</p>

  <p>Fig. 6 of Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, represents the well-known
  Chichi border stripe, composed of rosettes separated by
  diagonally drawn ribbon-like bars. To the rosettes are attached
  tri-cleft leaves. This stripe suggests at once some Persian vine
  and flower.</p>

  <p>What is known as the crab pattern (Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>,
  Fig. 7), is seen in Kazaks and other Caucasian nomadic rugs, as
  well as in a few very modern Asia Minor pieces. Though its
  resemblance to a crab is noticeable, it is really a rosette to
  which are attached four crudely drawn leaves, that frequently
  contain smaller designs at their centres.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
    <a name="pi" id="pi"></a><img src="images/platei.jpg" width="550" height="793" alt=
    "Plate I. Primary Border-Stripes of Caucasian Rugs" title="" />

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate I. Primary
    Border-Stripes of Caucasian Rugs</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>Slightly resembling the last is the so-called tarantula
  pattern (Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig. 8), that was possibly
  derived from the stripe with an eight-pointed star (Plate
  <a href="#pk">K</a>, Fig. 12, opp. Page 230); but it seems more
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id=
  "Page_227">227</a></span>probable that the inspiration is Iranian
  and that it is intended for rosette and double vine. This stripe
  is found in Kazaks, Genghas, Tcherkess, and other nomadic
  rugs.</p>

  <p>Somewhat like the last is the stripe of Plate <a href=
  "#pi">I</a>, Fig. 9, that is now and then seen in old Tiflis and
  other rugs of Southern Caucasia. It suggests a geometric rosette
  and double vine.</p>

  <p>Occasionally the dainty clover-leaf design, represented in
  Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig. 10, is used by the nomadic
  weavers. It is almost the only reciprocal pattern found in a
  Caucasian primary stripe.</p>

  <p>The repetitive urn-shaped pattern of Plate <a href=
  "#pi">I</a>, Fig. 11 is once in a while seen in old rugs of the
  Daghestan country.</p>

  <p>On account of the resemblance between the stripes shown in
  Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, Figs. 12 and 13, they have probably a
  common origin. Both are found in rugs of the Daghestan and
  Shirvan districts, and the former is occasionally seen in rugs of
  Asia Minor. Sometimes smaller adventitious devices are placed at
  the sides of the stripes between the rosettes.</p>

  <p>Resembling the last is the pattern shown in Plate <a href=
  "#pi">I</a>, Fig. 14, which is commonly seen in Shirvan rugs and
  kilims. It is purely geometric and resembles one used in Western
  Asia Minor rugs of the XV Century, from which it may have been
  derived.</p>

  <p>Though greatly conventionalised, the pattern represented in
  Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig. 15 is a vine and leaf derived
  from much more ornate forms, which may be seen in a XVI Century
  Asia Minor piece that is in the British Museum. It is now seldom
  copied, but was once a popular pattern for the Kazak and Kutais
  weavers.</p>

  <p>Some form of the latch-hook appears in a large number of
  Caucasian stripes, but mostly in nomadic pieces. Figs. 16, 17,
  18, 19, and 20 of Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, represent patterns
  found mostly in old Kazaks and kindred rugs. The last one is also
  occasionally used as a secondary stripe. The patterns shown in
  Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, Figs. 21 and 22 are from stripes
  sometimes seen in the Daghestan and Shirvan districts.</p>

  <p>A much more interesting stripe because of its well
  authenticated antiquity, is the one shown in Plate <a href=
  "#pj">J</a>, Fig. 1 (opp. Page 228). It is found in rugs made in
  Southern Caucasia two centuries ago, and according to Dr. Martin
  has been used since the XII Century. Probably as the result of
  copying, the design appears reversed in many old rugs.<a name=
  "FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class=
  "fnanchor">30</a> These stripes are seen in comparatively recent
  pieces, but principally</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id=
  "Page_228">228</a></span></p>

  <p>in those of the Daghestan and Shirvan districts. Though the
  latch-hook is suggested by the small triangular parts, it is more
  probable that originally they were intended for leaves. In a few
  stripes the design is elongated, and in place of a single
  crossbar there are several, forming a figure that slightly
  resembles a poinsetta, which is the term occasionally applied to
  it by weavers.</p>

  <p>The stripe shown in Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, Fig. 2, which
  is found in Kazak and other nomadic rugs, is interesting as
  representing a vine of which the pendant flower is replaced by a
  T formed by latch-hooks.</p>

  <p>In Figs. 3 and 4 of Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, are patterns of
  stripes found in rugs of the Shirvan and Daghestan districts. As
  they are several centuries old, they may be derived from Armenian
  patterns, to which they show kinship. Both patterns are at times
  reversed as the result of copying.<a name="FNanchor_31" id=
  "FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
  A stripe also used in the same districts and probably of similar
  origin is seen in Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, Fig. 5.</p>

  <p>Differing from any of these because of their utilitarian
  origin, are the separate designs, which arranged in perpendicular
  rows, form the &ldquo;churn&rdquo; stripe of Plate <a href=
  "#pj">J</a>, Fig. 6. Each of them represents crude machines for
  churning milk, which were formerly used by the nomadic tribes of
  Southern Caucasia and Armenia, who constructed them out of logs
  with a length of about five feet, and placed the sharpened base
  in the ground. Then hanging a goat&rsquo;s skin filled with milk
  over each of the sides, and seating themselves in the middle,
  they turned first one then the other. As might be expected, these
  stripes belong entirely to nomadic rugs.</p>

  <p>Figs. 7 and 8 of Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, represent stripes
  sometimes seen in Shirvans. The latter is undoubtedly derived
  from the prayer patterns that are often used in these rugs.</p>

  <p>What is known as the Georgian stripe is shown in Plate
  <a href="#pj">J</a>, Fig. 9. It is found in Daghestans,
  Kabistans, Shirvans, Soumaks, Shemakhas, and Kubas. Though a
  primary stripe, it is rarely placed at the centre of the border,
  but at the outer or the inner side, or at both sides with a less
  ornate stripe between. As a rule it accompanies only the more
  artistic rugs.</p>

  <p>Generally the primary stripes of Soumaks are different from
  those of other rugs. A few appear in Figs. 10, 11 and 12 of Plate
  <a href="#pj">J</a>. The last is interesting on account of the
  leaf-like forms of the octagonal designs.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id=
  "Page_229">229</a></span></p>

  <p>The stripes seen in Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, Figs. 13, 14
  and 15 are found only in nomadic rugs. The last is interesting
  principally on account of the swastikas.</p>

  <p>And old form now and then seen in the Daghestan-Shirvan
  classes appear in Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, Fig. 16. It is an
  archaic pattern copied from a most interesting Daghestan prayer
  rug.</p>

  <p>The stripe shown in Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, Fig. 17 is
  sometimes adopted in rugs of Southern Caucasia, such as the
  Kutais and Kazak.</p>

  <p>Another very old pattern found in the borders of the
  Daghestan-Shirvan classes is shown in Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>,
  Fig. 18. Though it suggests the narrow tertiary stripes known as
  &ldquo;barber-poles,&rdquo; it differs from them by being very
  much wider, and by containing bars of many different colours, as
  red, yellow, cream, blue, green, and brown, which generally
  contain short, oblong dashes.</p>

  <p>A very interesting stripe, found almost exclusively in rugs
  from the districts of Daghestan and Shirvan, is the Cufic pattern
  of Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, Fig. 19. It is particularly
  characteristic of old Daghestans and Kabistans, but must have
  been introduced through Shirvan from Armenia, as it can be traced
  through a gradation of changes to stripes of Cufic characters
  used in Asia Minor rugs of the XV Century.</p>

  <p>Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, Fig. 20 represents a
  &ldquo;bracket-chain&rdquo; pattern that probably originated in
  Asia Minor, but is occasionally found in the rugs of
  Caucasia.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, Fig. 21 is a stripe representing
  scorpions, that is very rarely seen in Shirvans; and in Fig. 22
  is a stripe representing birds, sometimes seen in Bakus.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Secondary and Tertiary
  Stripes.</span>&mdash;As the pattern shown in Plate <a href=
  "#pk">K</a>, Fig. 1 (opp. Page 230) shows in profile flowers
  representing carnations, it has been called the &ldquo;carnation
  pattern.&rdquo; It is very common in Shirvans, Kabistans, and
  Daghestans.</p>

  <p>Less frequently seen are the rectangular vine with a design
  like a three-leaf clover, shown in Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>,
  Fig. 2, and the very graceful vine with leaf and flower shown in
  Fig. 3, both of which are indiscriminately used in place of the
  carnation pattern in rugs with the same primary stripe. The
  latter is the most dainty and graceful Caucasian floral stripe.
  It is found in pieces of the Kabistan and Daghestan classes made
  over a century and a half ago, and is probably of Iranian
  extraction.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id=
  "Page_230">230</a></span>Another floral pattern from the same
  district is seen in Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>, Fig. 4. It often
  accompanies the Georgian stripe of Daghestans and Soumaks, with
  which its stiff drawing harmonises.</p>

  <p>Likewise, the stripe shown in Fig. 5 is found now and then in
  the same classes of rugs. Similar rosettes are sometimes
  represented in Persian stripes that show the influence of nomadic
  weavers.</p>

  <p>Simple forms of the running vine which are seen mostly in the
  rugs of Southern Caucasia are represented in Plate <a href=
  "#pk">K</a>, Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. All are old patterns. The
  third appears in an Asia Minor carpet woven about 1250
  <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> The fourth is found in some of
  the oldest remaining rugs from Southern Caucasia, that date back
  two and a half centuries; and a pattern similar to the last is
  seen in some Persian carpets made about 1650 <span class=
  "smcap">a. d.</span></p>

  <p>Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>, Figs. 11 and 12 represent stripes
  sometimes seen in Chichis and a few other Caucasian rugs.</p>

  <p>A very simple pattern, but one that at times is very
  attractive on account of its delicate colouring, is shown in
  Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>, Fig. 13, and another is shown in Fig.
  14. Both are used principally in rugs of Southern Caucasia.</p>

  <p>The stripe represented in Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>, Fig, 15,
  is found in very old rugs of the Daghestan and Derbend types; and
  there is a tradition among some of the native weavers that the
  designs originally represented boat hooks used by the sailors of
  the Caspian Sea. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the early
  weavers imitated objects of utility before those of mere
  ornament; but even if there is any basis for the tradition, it is
  equally probable that these designs are derived from the lily or
  other floral forms, and were introduced from Persia.</p>

  <p>Somewhat similar to the last is the reciprocal trefoil, which
  generally appears with more simple drawing than is shown in Plate
  <a href="#pf">F</a>, Fig. 17 (opp. Page 158). It is more widely
  used for a border stripe than any other pattern, as it is found
  in almost all Caucasian, in a large number of Persian, in Indian,
  and Beluchistan rugs. It was commonly used in Persian rugs as
  early as the year 1500.</p>

  <p>The dainty Chain pattern of Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>, Fig. 16
  has a well authenticated antiquity, as it is found in Asia Minor
  carpets of the XV Century, from which it was probably derived.
  Without doubt it was a favourite pattern three centuries ago, as
  it appears in some of the early paintings in which Oriental
  carpets are represented.</p>

  <p>Not infrequently the right-angled corners are rounded so as to
  give it a more graceful form.</p>

  <p>As the purely geometric pattern of Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>,
  Fig. 17 is entirely lacking in ornamental features, it is used
  principally to separate more important stripes. Occasionally it
  is found in such rugs as the Chichis and Shirvans.</p>

  <p>Another very simple pattern that is sometimes used as an
  inside stripe is seen in Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>, Fig. 18. This
  is evidently an archaic form and is found principally in pieces
  of the Shirvan district.</p>

  <p>The reciprocal sawtooth and the running latch-hook patterns
  (Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>, Figs. 19 and 20) belong to the less
  important stripes of not only Caucasian but a number of Persian
  rugs. The former pattern appears constantly on the monuments of
  ancient Susa, and doubtless had once some symbolic meaning. The
  latter is seen in the corners of the Dragon and Ph&oelig;nix
  carpet (Plate <a href="#p20">20</a>, opp. Page 88) which was
  woven about 1350 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span></p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

  <h4>CENTRAL ASIATIC RUGS</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/t.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="T"
  title="T" /></span>HE land that extends eastward about fourteen
  hundred miles from the Caspian Sea to the western boundary of the
  Chinese Empire, and northward for a similar distance from the
  Arabian Sea through Beluchistan and Afghanistan to the steppes of
  Western Siberia, is one of the least civilised parts of the
  eastern continent. Here until within a few recent years, the
  people lived the same untrammelled lives that their ancestors
  pursued for past centuries; and the encroachments of the Russian
  Empire on the north and the English on the southeast, have as yet
  made little impression on their uncultured natures. To these
  circumstances it is largely due that the rugs termed Central
  Asiatic, which come from this district, still possess to a large
  degree the originality of design, virility of character, and
  beauty of colour that are so rapidly disappearing from the woven
  products of countries more subject to the influence of Western
  civilisation.</p>

  <p>These rugs may conveniently be divided into three natural
  sub-groups, which include:</p>

  <p>1. The Turkoman, consisting of what are known in this country
  as Royal and Princess Bokharas, the Tekkes, Yomuds, Khivas, and
  Beshires, all of which are made in Turkestan;<a name=
  "FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class=
  "fnanchor">32</a> and the Afghan, of which part are made in
  Turkestan and part in Afghanistan.</p>

  <p>2. The Turko-Chinese, consisting of the Samarkands, which</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id=
  "Page_234">234</a></span></p>

  <p>are made in Western Turkestan, and the Kasghars and Yarkands
  made in Eastern Turkestan.</p>

  <p>3. The Beluchistans or Beluches, made principally in
  Beluchistan.</p>

  <p class="tb">No other rugs adhere more strictly to uniformity of
  colour and design than the Turkoman. And, when it is considered
  that their prevailing tones and their simple, geometric designs
  are such as would readily be adopted by people with primitive
  ideas of ornamentation, it seems probable that they have been
  copied with only slight modification for a great many centuries,
  even though more gorgeous and elaborate carpets were woven during
  the short period when Samarkand was capital of the East. This is
  probably true, notwithstanding no other country in the world has
  been subject to more conquests than Turkestan or overrun by so
  many different races. For here, as we learn by the aid of
  philology, dwelt the Aryans even before the light of history had
  come to dispel the mists of antiquity. Two or three thousand
  years later it was overrun by Cyrus and added to the dominion of
  the Medes and Persians. In the V Century <span class="smcap">a.
  d.</span>, Tartar tribes conquered it; and in the following
  century Turks and Persians divided it between them. Still later
  it was again overrun by the Arabs, who, sword in hand, converted
  the vanquished to the creed of Islam. When a few more centuries
  had rolled away the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan swept over it;
  and once again it suffered desolation under the iron hand of
  Tamerlane, &ldquo;Scourge of Asia.&rdquo; But in spite of these
  waves of conquest and the minor struggles with Persians, Greeks,
  and Romans, that left their impress on the country, each of the
  several classes of Turkoman rugs, including even those made two
  centuries ago, show a remarkable conformity to definite types,
  however much may be their modification in small detail. Their nap
  is invariably short; in all of them some shade of dark red is the
  predominating colour; and in most of them some form of an octagon
  appears. They are, moreover, the best woven and the most
  beautiful of the Central Asiatic rugs.</p>

    <p class="center">MAP OF TURKESTAN</p>
  </div>

  <p>Though the Turko-Chinese rugs are made in places subject to
  the influence of Turkomans and far removed from the culture of
  Chinese, they are unlike the rugs of the former and resemble
  those of the latter. Not improbably this is because Tamerlane had
  gathered at Samarkand noted artists and artisans from China,
  whose influence continued long after his death. And as
  traditional patterns have been transmitted for centuries, there
  is little doubt that some of the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>modern rugs, even though
  falling far short of the standard of their early prototypes, more
  closely resemble them than they do any other rugs of Asia. In
  these pieces Turkoman simplicity of geometric figures is replaced
  by an elaboration of conventional floral forms and by designs
  associated with early philosophies; sobriety of colour yields to
  the bright and even gaudy tones not infrequent in modern textile
  fabrics.</p>

  <p>The Beluchistans, which are regarded as a sub-group of the
  Central Asiatic rugs, show a closer relationship to the Turkoman
  rugs than to any others. A few of them have octagonal patterns
  suggestive of Bokharas, and all have the long webs at the ends
  and the heavy goat&rsquo;s hair selvage at the sides peculiar to
  Afghans and Tekkes. On the other hand, many of the patterns both
  of field and border resemble Persian workmanship; so that placing
  these rugs in the same group with the Turkoman and Turko-Chinese
  rugs, which are not made in an adjoining territory, is slightly
  arbitrary.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Royal
  Bokharas.</span>&mdash;The best known district in Turkestan is
  the Khanate of Bokhara, which extends from the offshoots of the
  lofty Pamir mountains in the east to the desolate sandy plains
  beyond the Amu Daria, or Oxus river, on the west. Situated in its
  northern half and near the centre of a fertile valley is its
  capital, Bokhara, &ldquo;The Noble.&rdquo; Though noted for its
  cruelty, it was once the intellectual centre of Asia, and still
  possesses nearly a hundred schools and innumerable mosques. These
  and its bazaars are almost all that remain of the splendour of
  those days when the great caravans that came from China, India,
  Persia, and Russia made it one of the great marts of the
  East.</p>

  <p>On account of its commercial importance, the wild tribes of
  the Kirghiz steppes, the Turkomans from Kizil Kum,<a name=
  "FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class=
  "fnanchor">33</a> the Afghans who dwell north of the Paropamisus
  range, and the fierce Tekkes and Yomuds from the west, came and
  bartered their rugs for other necessities. Many of these rugs
  were taken in caravans, that often numbered several thousand
  camels, and sold in the Russian market places of Astrakan,
  Orenburg, or Nijni Novgorod. Since they came from the same place,
  the term Bokhara was often applied to each of the different
  classes. Thus we hear of Royal Bokharas, Princess Bokharas, Tekke
  Bokharas, Yomud Bokharas, and Khiva Bokharas.</p>

  <p>Of these five classes the Royal Bokharas, as a rule, not only
  are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id=
  "Page_236">236</a></span>the best woven, but are made of the
  finest material; even the warp of many of them is of soft, silky
  white wool. The old rugs were made in the city and suburbs of
  Bokhara, where now only a few pieces are made. Both old and new
  are found only as sedjadehs. They have two well-known patterns,
  one of which consists of an octagon surrounding a quartered
  hexagon. Of these quarters, which are either plain or contain a
  small triangle of contrasting colour, a pair that are opposite
  are always white or cream coloured, and the other pair are of
  some shade of red. Small triangular figures are invariably seen
  above and below the hexagons, as well as small diamond, oval, or
  spear-shaped figures at each end of the major axis. In the other
  pattern the contour of the octagon is rounder; and the hexagon is
  replaced by an eight-pointed star, at the centre of which is a
  diamond containing a rectangle or occasionally a Greek cross.
  Projecting into the four corners from the star are small designs,
  that careful observation of a large number in many different
  kinds of rugs shows to be leaf forms. Between the diagonally
  placed octagons of both these types are stars or diamond-shaped
  figures, that are usually of the same design regardless of the
  shape of the octagon. In large rugs the centres of the octagons
  are generally joined by straight lines of dark blue colour.</p>

  <p>It is uncertain why the term Royal has been applied to this
  class of Bokharas, but it is eminently befitting the old
  well-woven, velvet-like pieces. A few have small patches of pink
  or ruby coloured silk; and all have a prevailing tone of red
  diversified by deep blues and touches of lighter red and ivory,
  that convey an idea of opulence and dignity worthy of a king.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dark
  red, with minor quantities of blue, pink or orange, and ivory.
  <i>Knot</i>, Sehna. Knots to inch horizontally eight to twelve;
  perpendicularly, sixteen to twenty-four. The rows of knots are
  firmly pressed down, so that the warp is concealed at back and
  the weft is almost hidden. <i>Warp</i>, fine white wool; each of
  the two threads encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back.
  <i>Weft</i>, wool, of fine diameter. A thread of weft crosses
  twice between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, fine wool, or
  occasionally silk, clipped short. <i>Border</i>, three stripes
  divided by smaller coloured lines. <i>Sides</i>, a blue double
  overcasting. <i>Both ends</i>, a narrow web and short warp
  fringe. <i>Texture</i>, firm. <i>Weave</i> at back is of fine
  grain. <i>Usual length</i>, four to ten feet. <i>Usual width</i>,
  three fifths to four fifths length.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id=

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Princess
  Bokharas.</span>&mdash;The rugs known as Princess Bokharas are
  woven by the Mohammedan tribes who dwell in parts of the Khanate
  of Bokhara. They are nearly square and the field is divided into
  four equal sections by perpendicular and horizontal bands.
  Because of this pattern they are called &ldquo;Katchlis,&rdquo; a
  word derived from the Armenian language signifying &ldquo;like a
  cross.&rdquo; The bands generally have designs that are
  co-ordinate with those in part of the border; but not
  infrequently the designs of the horizontal band differ from those
  of the perpendicular one, and in a few rare instances consist of
  an octagonal figure. It is generally believed that the well-known
  Y-shaped motive characteristic of the field and the border is
  intended to represent the tree of life, but some native weavers
  suggest a different interpretation. To them the whole rug
  symbolises a mosque; the perpendicular arm of the cross is the
  entrance; the Y-shaped designs are benches; and the broad
  diagonal lines with serrated edges in the borders are groves of
  trees surrounding the mosque. A very large percentage of these
  pieces are namazliks. One of their peculiarities is the position
  of their unobtrusive tent-shaped prayer arch, which is in a panel
  entirely within their upper border.</p>

  <p>Compared with Royal Bokharas their nap is rarely of as fine
  quality, the warp is usually of brown instead of cream white
  wool, and the weave is coarser. Also, the tones of colour are
  more sombre, and of browner shades; but in rare old pieces the
  rich mahogany and bronze hues of the ground, on which are
  represented small designs in shades of cream and dark blue, are
  exceedingly rich and pleasing. Unfortunately, within recent years
  large numbers of this class have been made solely for commercial
  purposes, and lack the finer qualities of their prototypes.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dark
  red or brown, with minor quantities of dark blue and ivory.
  <i>Knot</i>, Sehna. Knots to inch horizontally eight to twelve;
  perpendicularly, fourteen to eighteen. The rows of knots are
  firmly pressed down, so that the warp is concealed at back and
  the weft partly hidden. <i>Warp</i>, brown wool or goat&rsquo;s
  hair; each of the two threads of warp encircled by a knot is
  equally prominent at back. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of fine diameter. A
  thread of weft crosses twice between every two rows of knots.
  <i>Pile</i>, wool of short or medium length; occasionally some
  goat&rsquo;s hair is used. <i>Border</i>, three stripes,
  separated by narrow lines. <i>Sides</i>, a double overcasting or
  a double goat&rsquo;s hair selvage of three cords. <i>Both
  ends</i>, a web and warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>,
  stout.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id=
  "Page_238">238</a></span> <i>Weave</i> at back is of moderately
  fine grain. <i>Usual length</i>, four and one half to six feet.
  <i>Usual width</i>, two thirds to four fifths length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Tekkes.</span>&mdash;A little
  over two centuries ago there lived on the peninsula of
  Mangishlar, on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea, an almost
  unknown tribe called the &ldquo;Tekke,&rdquo; a term which is
  said to denote a mountain goat, and was applied on account of the
  headlong pace at which the men rode over rough mountain sides.
  About the beginning of the XVIII Century they packed their
  <i>khibitkas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_34" id=
  "FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
  and after moving southward to escape from the attacks of a more
  powerful tribe, they met the Yomuds in the southwestern corner of
  Turkestan and robbed them of their lands. Further eastward they
  snatched the fertile oasis of Ak-kal from some Kurds, whose
  ancestors a Shah of Persia had located there in earlier times to
  protect his kingdom from fierce northern tribes. By irrigating
  and cultivating the soil, they prospered and increased rapidly in
  population, until, about 1830, they numbered one hundred
  thousand. One fourth of them then moved eastward; and after
  settling on the banks of the Tajand, not far from the Persian
  town of Saraks, they attacked the inhabitants of Merv and
  captured the city. Growing thus to be a powerful people, they
  occupied much of the country between Persia and the Amu
  Daria.</p>

  <p>Ever restless, they were constantly looking for weaker foes on
  whom to fall; and when a leader would announce an intended raid,
  hundreds or even thousands would meet at the appointed rendezvous
  prepared to blindly follow him. Sometimes it was through the
  passes that looked down into the fertile valleys of Northern
  Persia. Stealthily creeping through them they would fall
  unexpectedly upon an unprotected village and dash away with young
  women and children. If pursued, they would stab their captives,
  and if necessary, ride more than one hundred miles a day in
  flight. At other times, they would attack caravans crossing the
  deserts and carry away both camels and wares.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 54. Turkoman Prayer
    Rug, which according to A. Bogolubow has the Typical
    Pind&eacute; Pattern</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>Their raids, however, were not viewed with complacence by the
  Russians, who had been steadily advancing on the land lying
  between the Caspian and the Amu Daria, and whose armies the
  Tekkes harassed. At length in January, 1881, came the final death
  struggle in the memorable attack on the fortress of Geok Teppe,
  where thirty-three thousand tribesmen and seven thousand women
  and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id=
  "Page_239">239</a></span>children had taken refuge. With the fall
  of that stronghold and the terrible punishment that followed, the
  power of the Tekkes was completely crushed; and a people whose
  ancestors for countless centuries had roamed the desert,
  recognising no master, yielded finally to the advance of
  civilisation.</p>

  <p>These were the people whose wives and daughters wove the rugs
  generally known as Tekke Bokharas, of which large numbers with
  excellent weave and sterling dyes can still be found. As few of
  them were designed for mosques or palaces, it is very unusual to
  find pieces over one hundred years old, and even these are rare.
  Indeed, any that are now forty years old should possess great
  interest, as they were woven at a time when the Tekkes were still
  a fierce race. Very many have the Katchli pattern. The prayer
  arch, which is similar to that of Princess Bokharas, is in a
  panel exterior to the field and within the border. Not
  infrequently there are three arches in the same horizontal panel,
  which, as a rule, is above the field, but occasionally below it.
  In a great many of these rugs the three-leaf clover is found in
  some part of the field; and in the band of pile that extends
  beyond the border at one end are usually small conventionalised
  bushes with white and yellow flowers. The pattern shown in Plate
  <a href="#pl">L</a>, Fig. 4 (opp. Page 250), appears almost
  invariably in the outer stripe.</p>

  <p>There are other types, into one of which it would seem as if
  the very spirit of the desert had crept. Their dark ground
  colours are brightened by lighter tones that give an effect of
  strange yet not inharmonious beauty. A few would seem to speak of
  the early Zoroastrian faith, for in their fields are designs like
  stars with effulgent rays that suggest the burning altars of fire
  worshippers.</p>

  <p>The shape or some peculiarity of the rug indicates the purpose
  for which it was intended. For instance, the rugs which were made
  for doors of the khibitkas have at the upper end a selvage with
  the web turned back and hemmed, and at each corner a heavy
  braided cord of about two feet in length, by which they were
  suspended. Other pieces have webs at both ends. Many beautiful
  pieces are made for use on horses or camels. Those intended for
  camels are of oblong shape with a field usually containing large
  octagons, between which are smaller octagons similar to those in
  Royal Bokharas.</p>

  <p>Tekkes may be distinguished from the Princess Bokharas, which
  they resemble, by their goat&rsquo;s hair selvage at the sides,
  by one thread of warp to each knot being slightly depressed at
  the back, and by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id=
  "Page_240">240</a></span> their coarser character. There is,
  however, a great similarity in the colours, though in the Tekkes
  tones of deep plum and rich red are not uncommon.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dark
  red, brown, or plum, with minor quantities of dark blue and
  ivory. <i>Knot</i>, Sehna. Knots to inch horizontally seven to
  twelve; perpendicularly, nine to fourteen. The rows of knots are
  slightly pressed down, but the warp shows at back. <i>Warp</i>,
  wool or goat&rsquo;s hair; one of the two threads encircled by a
  knot is depressed below the other at back. <i>Weft</i>, wool of
  fine or medium diameter. A thread of weft crosses twice between
  every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, or occasionally
  goat&rsquo;s hair of short or medium length. <i>Border</i>, three
  stripes, separated by coloured lines. <i>Sides</i>, a three-cord
  double goat&rsquo;s hair selvage. <i>Lower end</i>, a wide
  coloured web and long warp fringe. <i>Upper end</i>, a braided
  selvage turned back and hemmed, or occasionally a wide coloured
  web and long warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, firm. <i>Weave</i> at
  back of moderately fine grain. <i>Length</i>, five to eight feet.
  <i>Usual width</i>, three fifths to four fifths length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Khivas.</span>&mdash;On the
  west bank of the Amu Daria, and stretching for two hundred miles
  above its mouth, is the plain of the Khanate of Khiva. Most of
  the people live in khibitkas, and either follow a nomad&rsquo;s
  life or raise from the alluvial soil, that is watered by
  innumerable canals, crops of cotton, corn, and rice, as well as
  melons, peaches, and pomegranates. A large population, also,
  inhabits the city of Khiva, which before the building of the
  Siberian railway, was on one of the direct highways between east
  and west. Caravans of nearly two thousand camels regularly passed
  through it en route to Orenburg in spring and to Astrakan in
  fall, carrying wares from districts farther to the east as well
  as its own rugs and manufactured articles.</p>

  <h4><i>COLOUR PLATE IX&mdash;SAMARKAND RUG</i></h4>

  <p><i>Although this rug is an excellent example of that class
  generally known as Samarkands, it was bought in Yarkand.
  Undoubtedly it was woven in some part of Turkestan that lies
  between these two cities; yet with the exception of the
  eight-pointed stars at the centre of the upper and lower
  medallions the pattern is characteristic of Chinese
  ornamentation. Surrounding the central medallion, on a ground of
  rich deep blue, are six conventionalised butterflies, and near
  them are four clusters of pomegranates. At each end of the field
  are designs that suggest the tree of life, which under different
  forms appears so persistently in the woven fabrics of the East.
  The delicate drawing of these motives is accentuated by the
  formal character of the four corners and by the broad border of
  well-known stripes. It is a piece in which beauty of line and
  colour is combined with unsolved symbolism.</i></p>

  <p class="name"><i>Loaned by Mr. Hulett C. Merritt</i></p>

  </div>

  <p>On account of the constant intercourse between the Khiva and
  Bokhara tribes, their woven fabrics show a close relationship in
  patterns and colours; yet they contain important differences.
  Those made by the Khiva tribes are cruder, and reflect the effect
  of constant struggles against the rigours of the desert and the
  fierce Kirghiz from the steppes to the north. The wool is also
  coarser and longer, and the knots are much fewer to the inch.
  Occasionally geometric as well as animal designs suggestive of
  Caucasian influence occur. Moreover, the brownish threads of weft
  that separate each row of <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>knots, are noticeable at
  the back, whereas in other Turkoman rugs the weft is hardly
  perceptible.</p>

  <p>Many of the old pieces were very handsome, as is shown by the
  following description of an antique goat&rsquo;s hair carpet from
  Khiva by Dr. Birdwood.<a name="FNanchor_35" id=

  scrolls and lozenge-shaped forms in red, white, and orange, each
  lozenge being defined by a deep line of indigo blue. The ends
  terminate in a fringe. Professor Vambery says that these rich
  lustrous carpets are made entirely by the nomad women about
  Khiva, the head worker tracing out the design in the desert sand
  and handing out to her companions the dyed materials of different
  colours as required in the progress of weaving.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Yomuds.</span>&mdash;When, in
  1718, the Yomuds were driven by the Tekkes from their homes in
  the well-watered region about Kizil Arvat, they moved to a less
  fertile country to the north and west. Though now numbering about
  one hundred thousand, they have few villages; and regardless of
  the dreary sand storms, the biting cold of winter, or the
  terrible heat of summer, they wander with their sheep and goats
  from place to place in search of more favoured spots. Sometimes
  their khibitkas are seen along the border of the Caspian Sea as
  far south as Astrabad in Khorassan, or among the sandy trackless
  wastes of Kara Kum, nearly as far north as the Aral Sea.</p>

  <p>Many of their rugs rival the Royal Bokharas in wealth of
  colour. The prevailing tone of the field is usually red or
  maroon, but is sometimes rose, plum, or dark brown; and the
  remaining shades <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id=
  "Page_242">242</a></span>correspond with the blue, green, brown,
  and white of Tekkes. Contrasted with these is the ivory ground of
  the border, which, as a rule, has a much brighter colour than the
  field. Furthermore, the pile of the old pieces has a lustre that
  is due to the excellence of the dyes and the thick soft wool.</p>

  <p>There are several distinct types, of which only one is
  well-known. Its pattern is clearly Turkoman, though the lesser
  designs show that there has been frequent intercourse with the
  weavers of Caucasia. Covering the field of these pieces are
  regularly placed diamond-shaped figures that suggest those of the
  Royal Bokharas, from which they may have been developed to the
  almost entire exclusion of the octagon; though the latter appears
  much less prominently in the centre of the diamonds. In the
  border occurs the running latch-hook, the barber-pole stripe, and
  a geometrically drawn vine. The webs of the ends, which are
  usually red and striped, are broad and have a fringe of
  goat&rsquo;s hair, sometimes braided into ropelike tassels, but
  more often hanging loose.</p>

  <p>The saddle bags are of irregular shape resembling a flat
  walled tent, and contain in both field and border much brighter
  colour than the rugs. Their field is checkered with
  diamond-shaped figures rich in ivory colour and separated from
  each other by diagonal barber-pole stripes; their border contains
  the running latch-hook.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dark
  red and mahogany brown, with minor quantities of blue, green, and
  white. <i>Knot</i>, generally Sehna, occasionally Ghiordes. Knots
  to inch horizontally five to eight; perpendicularly, seven to
  ten. The rows of knots are pressed down, so that the warp is
  largely concealed at back. <i>Warp</i>, coarse wool or
  goat&rsquo;s hair; each of the two threads encircled by a knot is
  equally prominent at the back, or one is slightly depressed below
  the other. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of medium diameter, or occasionally
  wool mixed with goat&rsquo;s hair. A thread of weft crosses twice
  between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium
  length. <i>Border</i>, three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, either a
  two-cord selvage of red alternating with blue or brown, or a
  goat&rsquo;s hair double selvage of three or four cords. <i>Both
  ends</i>, a broad, reddish brown web through which, as a rule,
  run coloured lines or several narrow stripes, and a long warp
  fringe. <i>Texture</i>, stout. <i>Weave</i> at back is moderately
  coarse. <i>Usual length</i>, five to twelve feet. <i>Usual
  width</i>, two thirds to three quarters length.</p>

  "smcap">Beshires.</span>&mdash;On the Amu Daria and not far from
  Afghanistan is a small district from which the rugs known as
  Beshires now and then find their way to this country. As it is
  not far from several routes of caravans, these rugs show a
  relationship to the products of other Turkoman tribes. Their
  colour scheme is principally the dark red and brownish tones
  found in Bokharas, Yomuds, and Khivas. The ends, too, have the
  web crossed by several lines, such as blue, green, and yellowish
  brown, that are usual in Afghans. The patterns sometimes contain
  a suggestion of the geometric figures of the Yomuds and some
  Caucasian pieces; and yet they have a striking character of their
  own. Not infrequently the field is covered with broad, irregular
  scrolls or foliate forms, unlike anything seen in any other class
  of rugs. Again the field may be occupied with a trellis pattern,
  which divides it into diamond-shaped figures. Within these are
  smaller diamonds surrounded by eight-pointed stars and
  quasi-floral forms. The borders, as a rule, are narrow and have
  simple designs that incline to the geometric; but a few are of
  fair width and are ornamented with rosettes and conventionalised
  leaves. In namazliks, which are rarely seen, the prayer arch lies
  within the field. Almost all of this class found in this country
  are old rugs; and on account of their rich, harmonious colours
  and unobtrusive yet distinctive patterns, are always pleasing and
  interesting.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dark
  red and brown, with minor quantities of blue, yellow, and white.
  <i>Knot</i>, Sehna. Knots to inch horizontally seven to twelve;
  perpendicularly, seven to twelve. A half knot, as it appears at
  back, is as long as, or longer than, wide. The rows of knots are
  pressed down, so that the warp is almost hidden at back.
  <i>Warp</i>, generally goat&rsquo;s hair. Each of the two threads
  encircled by a knot is equally prominent at back, or occasionally
  one is slightly depressed. <i>Weft</i>, wool or goat&rsquo;s hair
  of medium or coarse diameter. A thread of weft crosses twice
  between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium
  length. <i>Border</i>, generally three stripes, occasionally only
  one. <i>Sides</i>, a goat&rsquo;s hair selvage of two to four
  cords. <i>Both ends</i>, a wide web, crossed with several
  coloured stripes. <i>Texture</i>, stout. <i>Weave</i>, coarse.
  <i>Length</i>, four to twelve feet. <i>Usual width</i>, two
  fifths to two thirds length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Afghans.</span>&mdash;One of
  the most distinctive classes of Turkoman rugs is known in this
  country both as Afghans and Khivas. Both of these<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span> names
  are unfortunately applied; for their only title to be called the
  latter is that many were formerly exported from the bazaars of
  Khiva, and that they slightly resemble the rugs of that city. Nor
  are they strictly Afghans, since they come from the territory of
  mountain ridges and fertile valleys that stretches from the Hindu
  Koosh Mountains northward across the eastern part of the Khanate
  Bokhara, and are made by the tribesmen of both countries. In
  fact, they differ considerably from the rugs of Central and
  Southern Afghanistan, and bear no resemblance to those of floral
  pattern woven about Herat.</p>

  <p>Within the territory where these rugs are made the Aryan and
  Teutonic races have met and blended; and across it have passed
  the armies of the greatest conquerors of Asia. Here still exist
  some of the most untamed races of the East, feeding their flocks
  on lofty table-lands, or cultivating patches of valleys, through
  which flow icy streams to form the Amu Daria. Here the rights of
  hospitality are held sacred, but wrongs are revenged without
  recourse to any tribunal.</p>

  <p>When the antecedents, customs, and surroundings of the people
  are taken into consideration, it is not strange that their rugs
  should be strong and firm in texture, bold in design, positive
  and striking in colour. Most of them are large and almost square
  in shape, though mats are not uncommon. The traditional pattern
  consists of perpendicular rows, usually three in number, of large
  octagons, that are almost in contact. Between these rows are much
  smaller diamond-shaped designs, which consist in some pieces of a
  cluster of eight-pointed stars, and in others of a geometric
  figure that is occasionally fringed with hooks and contains
  within its centre an eight-pointed star.</p>

  <p>With a few exceptions the octagons, which closely resemble
  those of Royal Bokharas, are symmetrical, and all their details
  are drawn as regularly as if the rugs were factory woven. They
  are invariably divided into quarters which usually are marked
  with a small figure like a three-leaf clover. The field contains
  but few adventitious designs and they are rarely animal, as the
  Afghans are Sunni Mohammedans. One of the most common of these
  designs, which appears also in the Tekkes and Yomuds, is probably
  intended to represent part of the headstall of camel trappings.
  The pattern of the border conforms to that of the field, but
  frequently has crudely drawn floral forms and a conventionalised
  vine. The sides have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id=
  "Page_245">245</a></span>an added selvage of brown goat&rsquo;s
  hair; and the ends are finished with reddish brown webs, from
  which hang loose fringes of dark wool or goat&rsquo;s hair.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 55. Turkoman Rug of
    the Salor Tribes</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>As characteristic as the large bold octagons are the colours,
  which however subdued are invariably of rich hues. Those of the
  field consist of dark red, maroon, or reddish brown. The quarters
  of the octagon are of a deep blue alternating with a red that is
  lighter than the field. In some pieces this red is blood colour,
  or nearly crimson, standing out in bold relief against the
  adjacent blue and a field of maroon. Lines of green, orange,
  yellow, and white often appear in the body of the rug; lines of
  dark blue and a checkered pattern in red and blue are frequent in
  the red webs of the ends.</p>

  <p>Though these rugs are, as a rule, heavier and coarser in
  texture than most other Turkoman rugs, the old pieces have a soft
  plushy nap of fine wool and goat&rsquo;s fleece, as well as
  richness of tone, that is very attractive. They are exceedingly
  durable and moderate in price.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally dark
  red and mahogany brown, with minor quantities of blue, green,
  yellow, and white. <i>Knot</i>, generally Sehna, occasionally
  Ghiordes. Knots to inch horizontally five to eight;

  down, so that the warp is largely concealed at back. <i>Warp</i>,
  coarse wool or goat&rsquo;s hair; each thread encircled by a knot
  is equally prominent at back, or one is slightly depressed below
  the other. <i>Weft</i>, wool, of medium diameter, or occasionally
  wool mixed with goat&rsquo;s hair. A thread of weft crosses twice
  between every two rows of knots. <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium
  length. <i>Border</i>, three stripes. <i>Sides</i>, a
  goat&rsquo;s hair double selvage of three or four cords. <i>Both
  ends</i>, a broad web of reddish brown colour through which run
  several narrow lines or several narrow stripes, and a long

  coarse. <i>Usual length</i>, five to twelve feet. <i>Usual

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Samarkands.</span>&mdash;A
  little over one hundred miles east of Bokhara, and on the
  southern border of the desert of Red Sands, the river Zarafshan,
  &ldquo;Strewer of Gold,&rdquo; has turned a plain of yellow loam
  into an oasis. Forty-three large canals bring its waters to
  fields of cotton; to vineyards; to orchards of apple, pear,
  peach, and pomegranate; and to gardens of fragrant flowers. Here
  is Samarkand, &ldquo;The Mirror of the World.&rdquo; Few cities
  as old remain after passing<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span> through so many
  vicissitudes of fortune. Alexander forced his way through its
  gates, the Chinese Empire annexed it, and finally Tamerlane
  seized and made it the magnificent capital of one third of the
  known world. His tomb and other remaining monuments attest the
  grandeur of that time when there was fostered here the art, the
  luxury, and the splendour of the East.</p>

  <p>The rugs known as Samarkands are woven in a district somewhat
  eastward from the city and are often called
  &ldquo;Malgarans.&rdquo; They are not to be compared with the
  magnificent carpets that adorned the palaces and mosques of the
  capital of Tamerlane; yet they possess a special interest, as in
  them are combined features derived from both Eastern and Western
  Asia. Either because this city, known as Samo-Kien, was once part
  of the Chinese Empire, or as is more probable, because it is on
  one of the great highways of caravan travel between China and
  Western Asia, the Chinese element is particularly noticeable. It
  appears in the colours that are in strong contrast; in the
  general pattern that shows little affinity for those of Persian
  or West Asian rugs; and even in the weave, in which silk is
  occasionally mixed with the wool of both warp and pile.</p>

  <p>The ground colour of the field is usually some shade of red or
  madder, with blue and yellow appearing conspicuously in the
  principal designs and border stripes. Or again, the field may be
  blue, soft brown, gray, or tan, with which the colours of the
  designs and borders, that may contain red, yellow, and blue,
  invariably appear in strong contrast.</p>

  <p>Few rugs have a more noticeable pattern, which consists
  principally of rounded medallions. If there be but one, it is in
  the centre; and if there be many, one is at each corner. They are
  usually ornamented with Chinese scrolls or some geometric design,
  as an eight-pointed star; but dragons, birds, or fishes are not
  uncommon. Occasionally, also, flowers of Persian design, with
  eight rounded petals, appear in the medallion, and others of
  larger size cover the field; or they may even exclude the
  medallion and constitute the principal motive. Some simple design
  in fretwork gives finish to the corners of the field, which is
  further covered with Chinese butterflies, scrolls, or archaic
  flower forms. The borders are equally distinctive, and unlike
  those of Chinese rugs are relatively wide and consist of several
  stripes surrounded by an edging of uniform colour. One of the
  stripes has generally a stiffly undulating vine; another a
  continuous swastika design; and a third is marked with frets, the
  bar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id=
  "Page_247">247</a></span>ber-pole design, or a design which by
  some is regarded as the sacred Chinese mountain rising from the
  waves. In most pieces warp and weft are loosely woven, and the
  pile is of a medium grade of wool; but in very old pieces the
  wool is fine and lustrous.</p>

  <p><i>Type Characteristics.</i> <i>Colours</i>, principally red,
  blue, and yellow. <i>Knot</i>, Sehna. Knots to inch horizontally
  six to eight; perpendicularly, five to eight. Each half knot, as
  it appears at back, is as long as, or longer than, wide. The rows
  of knots are not firmly pressed down, so that the warp shows at
  back. <i>Warp</i>, generally cotton, occasionally wool; one of
  the two threads encircled by a knot is doubled under the other.
  <i>Weft</i>, generally cotton, occasionally wool, of coarse
  diameter and frequently dyed. A thread of weft crosses twice,
  between every two rows of knots, and occasionally three times.
  <i>Pile</i>, wool, of medium length. <i>Border</i>, three stripes
  with a pink edging. <i>Sides</i>, a red or pink overcasting.
  <i>Lower end</i>, web and warp loops. <i>Upper end</i>, web and
  warp fringe. <i>Texture</i>, moderately firm. <i>Weave</i> at
  back, rather coarse. <i>Length</i>, six to fourteen feet.
  <i>Usual width</i>, one half to three fifths length.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Kashgars and
  Yarkands.</span>&mdash;Among the foothill plains at the western
  end of the Chinese Empire, are the mud-walled cities of Kashgar
  and Yarkand, that were ancient even in the days when Marco Polo
  visited there. Situated in populous and fertile districts, each
  has been a city of political and industrial importance; but on
  account of the great divides that separate them from Western
  Turkestan, Persia, and India, their commerce has been principally
  with Thibet and China. Thus it has happened that only within
  recent years have any of their textile fabrics reached Europe and
  America, where they are still almost unknown. Yet even in the
  remote past, these cities gained a reputation for the culture of
  silk and the weaving of carpets. Moreover, at different periods
  they were centres of luxury, so that it may safely be assumed
  that many of their woven products were of a high order of
  excellence.</p>

  <p>These rugs, to be sure, come from a district lying within the
  Chinese Empire; but it is so remote from the centres where the
  well-known Chinese rugs have been and are woven, and is so much
  nearer to West Turkestan and Afghanistan, that it seems best to
  place them in the Central Asiatic group.</p>

  <p>As a rule, such pieces as reach this country show crude
  workmanship entirely lacking in graceful floral patterns or
  artistic draw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id=
  "Page_248">248</a></span>ing. Octagonal forms, animals, and even
  mythical creatures are often distributed over the fields so as to
  give them a decidedly Chinese character. The narrow border
  stripes ornamented with the swastika and fret forms are often
  similar to some of the Samarkand stripes. The colours, which lack
  the subdued richness of Persian pieces, are often light; but they
  occasionally consist largely of tones of dark blue and red which
  show Turkoman influences. Most of these rugs are interesting on
  account of their quaintness and individuality; but few compare in
  quality of material, weave, or artistic finish with other classes
  of this group.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Beluches or
  Beluchistans.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;When creating the world, the
  Almighty made Beluchistan out of the refuse&rdquo; are the words
  of an old proverb, that refers to a land which formerly produced
  some of the most interesting rugs of the East. In fact, the
  thought is not surprising when the desolate character of the
  country is considered; for a sandy, waterless waste stretches
  over the greater part, and only in a corner to the northeast and
  in narrow strips, where streams from mountain sides water small
  valleys, is any cultivation. Across this sparsely settled land
  and farther westward into the southeastern part of Persia,
  untamed tribes of Beluches and Brahoes wander with their sheep,
  goats, and large numbers of camels. Their rugs, woven on crudely
  made looms, bear little resemblance to the more artistic floral
  pieces of the Indian weavers to the east or to those of Kirman to
  the west. Nor are they closely related to the Turkoman rugs with
  which they are usually grouped. In fact, they possess an
  individuality that once recognised is never forgotten; an
  individuality due to the isolated condition of a country that is
  protected from its nearest neighbours by barriers of deserts and
  mountain ridges, and is possessed by a still unconquered people.
  To these circumstances, also, it is due that the rugs are rarely
  coloured with aniline dyes, though many modern pieces have been
  chemically washed by dealers.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 56. Yomud
    Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>One of the most distinguishing features of Beluchistans are
  their tones of colour, that rarely depart from traditional usage.
  They are principally a red of the shade of madder, a blue with
  purple cast, and a dark brown that has sometimes a slight olive
  tinge, particularly when appearing in the webs. Frequently, too,
  dull tones of green are seen. Contrasting with these more subdued
  ground colours is almost invariably some ivory which appears as
  small detached <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id=
  "Page_249">249</a></span>figures in part of the border, or as
  outlines of principal designs. The patterns also show
  individuality and diversity. Most frequently they are geometric
  and represent some ill defined octagons suggesting Turkoman rugs.
  Or they may consist of a field covered with diagonal bands, with
  large lozenges, or medallions, all of which are decorated
  profusely with latch-hooks. Still others have some crudely drawn
  flower design, as the Mina Khani, that tells of Persian
  influences.</p>

  <p>A fair proportion have the prayer pattern, consisting of a
  large rectangular shaped mihrab, which is as high as, and
  frequently higher than, wide. The borders, as a rule, consist of
  three or four stripes. The main stripe is geometric and in the
  guard stripes are running latch-hooks or the reciprocal trefoil,
  though occasionally they are replaced by some conventionalised
  vine or ribbon pattern.</p>

  <p>Proportionally to their length few other rugs have such long
  webs at the end, though they are sometimes entirely worn away
  while the body of the rug is still serviceable. They are usually
  coloured in harmony with the colours of the field, and are marked
  with embroidered lines or simple designs. No other rugs have a
  surface with more lustrous sheen, due to the soft, fine wool of
  the pile, which in old pieces is short and closely woven, giving
  a play of colours, and velvety appearance unsurpassed by any
  other nomadic rugs. Many of the choicest pieces of Beluchistan
  weave now on the market are the small saddle bags, that are of
  rich yet subdued colours, and possess the character and sheen of
  very old rugs.</p>

  <h4>BORDER STRIPES</h4>

  <p>The border stripes of the Central Asiatic group are even more
  geometric than the Caucasian; for it is rarely that any floral
  forms are seen in them, though they may appear in the pile that
  extends beyond the borders of the ends. Even the vines are so
  angular as almost to lose their identity. Octagonal figures,
  stars, frets, and latch-hooks are common. In fact, the group as a
  whole, shows the influence of the Caucasian and Chinese groups
  more than the Persian.</p>

  <h4>PRIMARY STRIPES</h4>

  <p>The stripe shown in Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Fig. 1 (opp.
  Page 250) is one of many found in the rugs known as Royal
  Bokharas. The eight-pointed stars, as well as the small tent-like
  designs, which may have been derived from the headstalls of
  horses, are almost always found in it.</p>

  <p>A well-known stripe of Princess Bokharas corresponding with
  the pattern of the field, appears in Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>,
  Fig. 2. It represents a continuous series of designs shaped like
  a Y, that were doubtless derived from forms of trees. More
  frequently the stripe (Fig. 3) of broad, serrated diagonal lines,
  that originally may have been intended to represent foliage, is
  seen.</p>

  <p>Another stripe found in Princess Bokharas and also in Tekkes
  and Khivas is shown in Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Fig. 4. It
  forcibly suggests the Chinese fret. Sometimes it is used as a
  primary but more frequently as a secondary stripe.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Fig. 5, is a stripe frequently
  seen in Tekkes, which is interesting on account of the
  eight-pointed stars and latch-hooks similar to those of Caucasian
  rugs. Without doubt this is only one of the many instances
  illustrating the migration of designs.</p>

  <p>Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Fig. 6 represents a stripe peculiar
  to Yomuds. The running vine is most mechanically drawn and
  fringed with latch-hooks, which are a constant feature of this
  class.</p>

  <p>Another Yomud stripe with vine in which serrations take the
  place of latch-hooks is shown in Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Fig.
  7. Pendent from the vine are other hooks shaped like frets.</p>

  <p>Very similar to an old Caucasian stripe is the one represented
  in Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Fig. 8; but in this stripe the
  small designs are drawn so that the proportion of length to width
  is greater; and it is probable that they were copied from a
  wreath of leaves. This stripe is very commonly seen in
  Beluchistans.</p>

  <p>Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Fig. 9 represents a mechanically
  drawn vine found in Beshires.</p>

  <p>Well-known Afghan stripes are shown in Plate <a href=
  "#pl">L</a>, Figs. 10 and 11.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Figs. 12 and 13 are two of the
  most typical and interesting stripes of Samarkands and Yarkands.
  The first is supposed to represent the sacred mountain of Chinese
  lore rising out of the waves. The second is a vine with leaves
  and flowers, which suggest Persian influences.</p>

  <p>A stripe with simple archaic pattern peculiar to Yarkands is
  seen in Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Fig. 14.</p>

  <h4>SECONDARY STRIPES</h4>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Fig. 15 (opp. Page 250), is a
  well-known form of a secondary stripe found in Royal
  Bokharas.</p>

  <p>A stripe seen in both Princess Bokharas and Tekkes is shown in
  Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Fig. 16. It bears a slight resemblance
  to some conventionalised vines found in other groups.</p>

  <p>Stripes of running latch-hooks (Plate <a href="#pk">K</a>,
  Fig. 20, opp. Page 230) are frequently found in Yomuds, and
  occasionally in Beluchistans.</p>

  <p>In Beluchistans the reciprocal trefoils, so well-known in
  Caucasian and Persian rugs, are very frequently used.</p>

  <p>The pattern of a double vine, illustrated in Plate <a href=
  "#pl">L</a>, Fig. 17, is a Beshire stripe that suggests a Persian
  influence.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Fig. 18, is the narrow pear
  stripe that appears in a very large number of Afghans and in some
  Khivas.</p>

  <p>Two well-known stripes that belong to Samarkands are shown in
  Plate <a href="#pl">L</a>, Figs. 19 and 20. The pattern of the
  conventionalised vine speaks of Persian origin, and the swastikas
  suggest Chinese origin.</p>

  <p>In Tekkes, Yomuds, Afghans, and Beluchistans the small
  barber-pole stripes are constantly employed.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

  <h4>INDIAN RUGS</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/t.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="T"
  title="T" /></span>HROUGHOUT parts of India are woven rugs known
  as <i>Dari</i>, which are unlike the rugs of any other country.
  They are pileless cotton fabrics, that may represent an
  indigenous craft old as the Aryan migrations. Their designs are
  of the simplest order; usually no more than plain stripes of
  blue, red, and black, or only blue and white modified
  occasionally by simple geometric figures. Furthermore, their
  workmanship is poor, so that they possess little artistic merit.
  Some pieces of large size are exported, but they awaken but
  little interest compared with other kinds of rugs.</p>

  <p>The weaving of pile carpets in India, on the other hand, does
  not appear to have been the result of spontaneous growth or to
  have flourished without artificial encouragement. It was probably
  introduced by the Saracens, but carpets of elaborate design and
  workmanship were not made till the reign of Shah Akbar, who
  imported Persian weavers. Under his patronage and the
  encouragement of his royal successors, the manufacture of pieces
  that rivalled those of Persia continued for a hundred years, but
  after the death of Shah Jahan, in 1658, the industry began to
  decline. Nevertheless, for nearly a hundred years longer
  excellent fabrics were produced as the result of the system that
  was maintained in all the provinces by lesser potentates. This
  system, which was also in vogue in parts of Persia, is described
  by Dr. George Birdwood as follows: &ldquo;The princes and great
  nobles and wealthy gentry, who are the chief patrons of these
  grand fabrics, collect together in their own houses and palaces
  all who gain a reputation for special skill in their manufacture.
  These men receive a fixed salary and daily rations and are so
  little hurried in their work that they have plenty of time to
  execute private orders also. Their salaries are continued even
  when through age or accident they are past work; and on their
  death they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id=
  "Page_254">254</a></span> pass to their sons, should they have
  become skilled in their father&rsquo;s art. Upon the completion
  of any extraordinary work, it is submitted to the patron; and
  some honour is at once conferred on the artist and his salary
  increased. It is under such conditions that the best art work of
  the East has always been produced.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After the overthrow of the Mogul dominion by Nadir Shah, in
  1731, the production of carpets rapidly diminished and the
  quality deteriorated. This was due to several causes. With the
  conquests of the East Indian Company, that began in the middle of
  the XVIII Century, and the extension of trade into every
  district, large quantities of antique carpets became the property
  of the Company or of those in its employ. Many of them, including
  sumptuous pieces that had adorned the palaces of the descendants
  of Tamerlane, found their way to England. Thus were removed many
  of the masterpieces that had been an inspiration to the weavers.
  Moreover, with the overthrow of native princes their patronage
  ceased; and later, when looms were established in jails for the
  employment of convicts, undesirable competition reduced the wages
  of free labour. Still more pernicious was the introduction of
  aniline dyes, and the elimination of individual taste by
  supplying patterns, that were often of European origin, to be
  mechanically copied. Thus it followed that, in spite of the
  efforts of Mr. Robinson and of others, for nearly half a century,
  to resuscitate the art and restore it to its former condition,
  weaving in India, to-day, rests purely on a commercial basis; and
  the workmanship is almost as mechanical as the manufacture of
  machine-made carpets in Europe or America.</p>

  <p>Yet to the cloud hanging over the weaving of India is a
  brighter lining. European companies have established factories
  where natives are employed making rugs that in quality equal the
  products of Smyrna and Sultanabad. Some of them, indeed, are even
  more firmly woven than the Persian products from which they are
  copied. In many of the towns, also, are looms where the weavers,
  who are mostly boys, enjoy more independence. Moreover, the
  companies, realising that the future of their business depends on
  the quality of the fabrics, are largely discarding aniline dyes.
  It is now possible, therefore, to obtain Indian rugs of excellent
  workmanship and colours at very moderate prices; but
  individuality, representative of native character and
  temperament, is entirely lacking; and in its place is simply a
  reproduction of Persian or European patterns.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 57. Beshire Prayer

  </div>

  <p>Any arrangement of these rugs in sub-groups must be arbitrary,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id=
  "Page_255">255</a></span>as similar conditions of early foreign
  influence, royal patronage, and the jail and factory systems,
  have prevailed throughout India. Yet since the northern part has
  been more directly under the influence of the courts and more
  intimately connected with Herat, which seems to have left a
  strong impress on the weavings of all the surrounding country, it
  is convenient to make a distinction between the rugs of Northern
  and Southern India.</p>

  <p>The principal rug-producing centres of Northern India at
  present are Srinagar, Amritsar, Lahore, Multan, Allahabad, Agra,
  Mirzapur, Sindh, Jubbulpur, and Jaipur.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Srinagar</span>.&mdash;From the
  extreme northern part of India come the rugs of Kashmir, which
  are often named after the capital of the province, Srinagar, the
  &ldquo;City of the Sun.&rdquo; To a large extent, they resemble
  the far more famous shawls that were woven in the central valley,
  where winds the Jhelum, that some believe first suggested the
  pear design. The pieces woven before the British occupation of
  India were of excellent quality and contained delicate colour
  schemes, that were exceedingly pleasing; but the products of the
  last half century show deterioration. The colours are harsher,
  the mechanical drawing of the patterns show European influence,
  and the borders resemble too closely the central field to have
  distinct characters. Yet many of them are now dyed with vegetable
  colours, and are stoutly woven with the soft and silky wool for
  which this district is renowned.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Amritsar</span>.&mdash;On
  account of famine and several other causes, a large number of the
  people of Kashmir migrated about the year 1840. Some of them
  settled at Amritsar, where they followed their former craft of
  making shawls, until a change of fashion, that occurred about the
  year 1870, deprived many of their occupation. These turned to rug
  weaving and thus gave an impetus to that industry.</p>

  <p>Amritsar is now the most populous and wealthy city of the
  Punjab; and as some twenty thousand men and boys are employed at
  the looms, it is one of the leading rug-producing centres of
  India. Yet before the exhibition of Indian rugs at the
  World&rsquo;s Fair in Chicago, in 1893, there had not been any
  demand in this country for its rugs. For a long period it has
  been the home of weavers who found in the surrounding mountains
  and valleys the best of wool, but<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span> before the revival of the
  industry their patterns and workmanship were of an inferior
  character. Under the factory system, conducted by American and
  English firms, has been a marked improvement. Both dyes and wool
  are excellent, and the technique of weave equals what is found in
  the best of Persian products, to the square inch are frequently
  two hundred Sehna knots; and since when tying a knot one thread
  of warp is doubled under the other, as in Bijars, and the threads
  of weft are pressed down very firmly, the texture is unusually
  close. The nap is short; the sides are overcast; and as a rule,
  the lower end has a cotton web and the upper end a web and
  fringe. The moderate prices for rugs of such excellent dyes and
  workmanship are possible only on account of the wage of the
  weaver, which does not exceed one eighth what he would receive in
  this country.</p>

  <p>There is nothing, however, in the pattern to distinguish these
  rugs from others; for in the drawing the greatest latitude is
  exercised. It may be a copy of a European carpet, or some Indian
  or Iranian antique. Of recent years, many well-known modern
  Persian patterns have been followed, so that not infrequently
  these pieces are mistaken for the products of Kermanshah or
  Sultanabad.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Lahore</span>.&mdash;About the
  year 1580, the imperial carpet factory of Shah Akbar was
  established at Lahore, the capital of the Punjab; where during
  the reign of the Mogul princes were produced many of the best
  examples of Indian weaving. It was here that, in 1634, was woven
  the well-known carpet now in the possession of the
  Girdler&rsquo;s Company of London. Some of the pieces that still
  remain show wonderful delicacy of drawing and brilliancy of
  colouring. At a much later period, under the British rule, the
  jail system of weaving was inaugurated, and rugs were made with
  both woollen and cotton foundation. Within more recent years the
  factory system followed; and on account of the nearness of
  Amritsar to the capital, some foreign firms have weaving
  establishments in both cities. It is not surprising, then, that
  there should be a resemblance in their products, which is seen in
  the finish of sides and ends and in the character of weaving,
  which usually shows one thread of warp to each knot doubled under
  the other; but as a rule the rugs of Lahore come in lighter
  shades and are woven with fewer knots to the square inch. In the
  guards of the border often appear geometric figures; but the
  patterns in other respects largely follow well-known<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span> Persian
  drawing, though leaf and flower are more artistically portrayed
  and the designs are less crowded.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Multans</span>.&mdash;One of
  the most ancient cities of the Punjab is Multan, which during the
  vicissitudes of centuries was more than once captured by early
  Mohammedan conquerors and also by Tamerlane. Its woven fabrics
  are of three types: the <i>Dari</i>, which are made almost
  exclusively in the jails; rugs of cotton pile, that have been
  made only within the last sixty years; and rugs of woollen pile,
  that have been produced for an unknown period. As the looms on
  which they are made are unlike those of other districts, and the
  weavers are but little affected by external influences, it is not
  surprising that the pile carpets not only display uniqueness of
  pattern rarely seen in other Indian pieces but also possess
  peculiarities of weaving as well as of material. Usually they are
  of moderate size, but some have a breadth of twelve feet. There
  are seldom more than one hundred knots to the square inch and
  occasionally only nine, so that the texture is coarse. Not
  infrequently a single knot encircles four threads of warp, and
  between two rows of knots is a single thread of weft. Almost all
  of the weavers are Mohammedans, who have a tradition that they
  originally came from Persia; yet their products contain few of
  the Iranian characteristics, since the field is usually occupied
  by geometric designs or crudely drawn floral patterns. As is
  seldom the case with weavers who dwell in cities, these dye their
  own wool, using both vegetable and aniline dyes. The principal
  colours are bold and strongly contrasting tones of red, yellow,
  and blue. Some of the cotton rugs, however, have a single colour
  of bluish shade. On the whole, the Multan rugs possess great
  individuality but little artistic merit.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Agra</span>.&mdash;Almost
  within sight of the minarets of the Taj Mahal are prison walls
  where convicts of Agra ploddingly weave. In 1891, Dr. John Hurst
  &ldquo;saw a long row of prisoners for life, who were chained to
  each other by the feet, engaged in weaving a rug for Queen
  Victoria, and another for the ex-Empress Eugenie.&rdquo; Most of
  these pieces are of cotton foundation. Each thread of warp is
  equally prominent at the back, and the texture is looser than in
  Amritsars. The nap is short, and the fibres of the knots blend
  well together. Not infrequently the fields are monotones of
  delicate shades of blue, green, or fawn colour. As a rule, the
  rugs are very large and heavy; and<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span> it would seem that this
  has always been the case, as Mr. Robinson suggested that the
  reason for establishing looms at this place was the early demand
  for carpets too large to be imported on elephants.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class=
  "smcap">Allahabad</span>.&mdash;Situated like Benares on the
  banks of the Ganges, and next to it the most sacred city of India
  to the faithful Brahman, is Allahabad, capital of the
  northwestern provinces. Its geographic and political importance,
  as well as the fact that each year half a million or more
  devotees visit it, have been important factors in the growth of
  its industries, one of which is the weaving of rugs. Yet the
  numbers produced have never been great. As a rule they are of
  large size, and are loosely woven with each thread of warp
  equally distinct at the back. Few of them equal the best examples
  of the Amritsar looms.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Mirzapur</span>.&mdash;When it
  is considered that Mirzapur is the centre of a very populous
  cotton-producing district in the valley of the Ganges, to the
  west of Benares, and is the seat of important manufactures, it is
  not surprising that it is noted for its carpets. Those made half
  a century ago were well woven and dyed with fast colours, but
  largely on account of the employment of convicts, the texture of
  those made since then is coarse and loose, the patterns are poor,
  the colours crude. To a limited extent a higher grade of wool has
  been imported as a substitute for the harsh local product, but
  the result has not been satisfactory. These rugs accordingly find
  small favour among those who appreciate artistic qualities, and
  give little satisfaction where durability is the chief requisite.
  It should be noted, however, that within recent years efforts
  have been made to raise their standard.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Jubbulpur</span>.&mdash;Two
  hundred miles to the southwest of Allahabad is Jubbulpur, capital
  of a district of over half a million people. A century ago many
  beautiful rugs were woven there; but since the establishment of a
  School of Industry, in 1850, the character of weaving has
  retrograded rather than advanced. In 1880, Dr. Birdwood wrote of
  its rugs as follows: &ldquo;The foundation, as now scamped is
  quite insufficient to carry the heavy pile which is a feature of
  this work; and is moreover so short in the staple as to be
  incapable of bearing the tension even of the process of
  manufacture. Jubbulpur carpets often reach this country (England)
  which will not bear <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id=
  "Page_259">259</a></span>sweeping, or even unpacking. I know of
  two which were shaken to pieces in the attempt to shake the dust
  out of them when first unpacked. The designs once had some local
  character, but have lost it during the last four or five
  years.&rdquo; Within recent years few have been exported.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Sindh</span>.&mdash;Formerly
  good rugs were woven at Sindh, one hundred miles above the mouth
  of the Indus; but after the introduction of aniline dyes their
  colours, as well as patterns, deteriorated. In the poorest pieces
  the foundation was of cotton and hemp, and cow hair was
  frequently used for pile. Very few of them have been imported
  into this country.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Jaipur</span>.&mdash;In the
  palace of the Maharajah at Jaipur, the great commercial centre of
  Rajputana, are some of the most beautiful carpets that remain in
  India. Native appreciation is also apparent in the present
  workmanship of the district weavers. There is nothing crass or
  inelegant in the patterns which follow the pleasing drawing of
  Persian rugs. The vine, leaf, and flower, trees, and animals are
  faithfully portrayed. The texture of weave is excellent.</p>

  <p>The principal rug-producing centres of Southern India are
  Madras, Marsulipatam, Ellore, Vellore, and Bangalore. Rugs are
  also woven in Hyderabad, Warangal, and Ayyampet in the Tanjore
  district.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Madras</span>.&mdash;Only
  within a comparatively recent period have rugs been made at
  Madras, the early stronghold of the British in South India. Over
  half a century ago, native products, woven in the interior towns
  of the Dekkan, were shipped by way of Coconada to that city and
  were sometimes known as Madras rugs. Two of these pieces, which
  were sent by Mr. Vincent Robinson to the South Kensington Museum,
  differ widely in harmony of colours, beauty of design, and
  delicacy of workmanship from the present products of Madras. Yet
  the latter have much to commend them. Some are made in the jail,
  others in the School of Fine Arts, and others in the Anjuman
  Industrial School. All are made of good wool, coloured with
  vegetable dyes. Great diversity appears in the patterns, as some
  are copied from antique carpets represented in the &ldquo;Vienna
  Carpet Book,&rdquo; others are copied from rugs of Northern
  India, Persia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id=
  "Page_260">260</a></span> and Asia Minor. As a rule, the fields
  are well covered with repetitive designs, that give them the
  appearance of factory-made carpets.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Marsulipatam</span>.&mdash;Two
  hundred and fifty miles north of Madras on the Coromandel coast
  is the city of Marsulipatam, one of the earliest of the British
  settlements in India, from which the East India Company shipped
  rugs over two centuries ago. At that time they were among the
  finest produced in that country, but the demands of agents for
  articles that could be produced as cheaply as possible resulted
  in the use of inferior materials and in poorer workmanship. Most
  of the dyes are aniline. The patterns, that once were executed
  with marvelous beauty of detail, gave way to crude drawing until
  &ldquo;these glorious carpets of Marsulipatam have sunk to a
  mockery and travesty of their former selves.&rdquo;<a name=
  "FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class=
  "fnanchor">36</a> Few of them are any longer imported into this
  country.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Ellore</span>.&mdash;Not far
  from the delta of the Godavari river is the town of Ellore, where
  a few centuries ago some Persians settled, and where their
  descendants, faithful to early tradition, have followed the craft
  of weaving. Here in former times were produced some of the best
  rugs in Southern India; and even as late as 1883, Mr. E. B.
  Havell wrote that he had seen pieces woven to meet special orders
  which were equal in point of interest and material to the old
  specimens in the hands of connoisseurs of London or in native
  palaces. This is one of the few districts in Southern India where
  the industry exists outside of jails. In the town and surrounding
  country are about four hundred looms operated by some three
  thousand people, who are Mohammedans.</p>

  <p>In the better class of rugs, in which vegetable dyes are still
  used, and the yarn is often a native product of wool obtained
  from sheep of the uplands and spun by shepherds, something of the
  old style of craftsmanship remains. On the other hand, a very
  large percentage of the rugs which are intended solely for export
  trade are of an inferior order, since many of their colours are
  obtained from aniline, their weaving is inferior, and their
  patterns are ordinary. Mr. Henry T. Harris, in his report on the
  Madras Industrial and Art Exhibition, 1903, said: &ldquo;The
  exhibits of carpets sent from Ellore were poor in conception,
  weave, and colour.... The patterns in use were poor and often
  modifications of cheap Wilton, Kidderminster, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>and
  German power loom designs. Some of the old patterns are still
  with the weavers, but unfortunately there is no trade demand for
  this fine class of goods, the old dyes are being forgotten and
  have given place to cheap anilines unskilfully
  applied.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 59. Afghan
    Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>In length, the rugs are from a few feet to twenty-four feet.
  The warp is of cotton, and the weft is sometimes of jute or hemp.
  The pile is of an inferior quality, as it consists largely of the
  wool taken from a sheep after death, known as &ldquo;dead&rdquo;
  wool, or as &ldquo;Chunam&rdquo; or &ldquo;limed&rdquo; wool,
  since it is necessary to treat it with lime. Unfortunately
  vegetable dyes do not produce in it the same results as in
  &ldquo;live&rdquo; wool; and since the scarcity of wool in
  Southern India frequently necessitates its use, aniline dyes are
  for this reason alone often employed. The number of knots to the
  square inch is relatively small. The patterns show great
  diversity, as Persian features predominate in the older rugs; but
  both geometric and floral designs are employed in the modern.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Vellore</span>.&mdash;Almost a
  hundred miles to the west of Madras is the town of Vellore, where
  native weavers once produced fine woollen carpets on their own
  looms. A few specimens of these old pieces are preserved in the
  jail to serve as patterns for the convicts, who now weave the
  only rugs of the district. There are some fifty looms; and as the
  largest is about thirty feet wide, almost any size of rug may be
  obtained. The product rests on a commercial basis and depends on
  the market demands, restricted by the material available and the
  limitations of the weavers. According to the order, the rugs may
  be coloured with vegetable or aniline dyes; they may have warp
  and weft of cotton, jute or hemp; and they may have from six to
  sixteen knots to the inch measured horizontally and
  perpendicularly. In the patterns, which are as promiscuous as
  those of Ellore and often similar, the Herati design with a
  corresponding border is not infrequently used. Recently an effort
  has been made to exclude all but vegetable dyes and improve the
  craftsmanship.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Bangalore</span>.&mdash;The
  principal weaving industry in the Mysore state is centred about
  Bangalore, a city of about two hundred thousand inhabitants. Its
  founder, Hyder Ali, is said to have established looms and to have
  imported the first weavers. In 1908, the nine jail looms, of
  which the largest had a length of nearly thirty feet, were
  constantly occupied in making rugs to order. The number
  of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id=
  "Page_262">262</a></span> knots to the square inch varied greatly
  according to the quality required; and the dyes were almost
  entirely aniline. In the city are employed a much larger number
  of weavers, who clean and spin the wool produced in the district,
  as well as dye it by secret processes, that they guard most
  carefully. The closeness of texture; the colouring by aniline or
  vegetable dyes; and the use of cotton, jute, or hemp, for warp
  and weft, are regulated by the requirements of the trade, which
  is conducted largely by two or three English firms.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class=
  "smcap">Hyderabad</span>.&mdash;Splendid craftsmanship was once
  displayed in the rugs made in the cities of Hyderabad and
  Warangal, in the district of Hyderabad. The weave was exceedingly
  fine, and the colours were brilliant but harmonious. Now few rugs
  are produced in these cities, and they have poor patterns and
  wretched colours.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

  <h4>CHINESE RUGS</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/t.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="T"
  title="T" /></span>HE existence of Chinese rugs of age and merit
  was almost unknown to the Western world until the close of the
  last century, when a few pieces reached Europe, where they
  aroused the just admiration of art connoisseurs. About the
  beginning of this century a larger number, which were obtained
  during the Boxer revolution by reason of the spoliation of homes,
  temples, and palaces, that never before had been entered by
  foreigners, were exported to this country. In New York City,
  between the years 1908 and 1910, some of them were sold at public
  auctions for prices that stimulated collectors in China to search
  for more. But they have proved to be scarce when compared with
  other Oriental rugs, so that, as yet, the general public are only
  slightly familiar with them.</p>

  <p>Moreover, little is known about their antecedents, for written
  records are exceedingly meagre. It has been suggested that many
  were made in Eastern Turkestan along the highways that extend to
  Persia and India. But it is more probable that they were woven in
  Eastern China, where other branches of art reached a remarkable
  development under the patronage of wealthy mandarins and the
  imperial court. Even if they are not the product of an indigenous
  growth, the knowledge of weaving may easily have been acquired
  from Western Asia; since it was not unusual several centuries ago
  to import weavers from one country to another to instruct native
  craftsmen. Furthermore, the features which at a glance
  differentiate these rugs from all others, proclaim their Chinese
  character. The diaper patterns that cover the fields of some of
  them, and the foliate and floral forms that appear in most of
  them, not only are unlike those of any other groups, but have
  well-known Chinese elements. A more distinctive feature are the
  colours, which are relatively few. Many of them, as tan, yellow,
  and blue, are of shades<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264"
  id="Page_264">264</a></span> unlike what are seen in other rugs.
  Even more distinctive than these are the reds, which never have
  the primary colours found in other groups but resemble the tints
  of ripe apricot, peach, pomegranate, and persimmon. Similar tones
  are seen in old Chinese porcelain. The geometric and floral
  ornamentation also shows relationship to what is found in the
  products of other branches of Chinese art. More characteristic
  still are the small designs which are so related to the
  philosophic and religious thought of the people and to the
  industrial and social life that their Chinese origin is
  unmistakable.</p>

  <p>Though it be granted that nearly all were woven in Eastern
  China, it is not possible satisfactorily to assign them to
  different classes based on locality; yet without doubt important
  distinctions, observable also in the early paintings and
  porcelains and resulting largely from differences of race and
  character of country, exist between those woven in Northern
  China, where the highest appreciation of art existed, and those
  woven in Southern China. It is probable, however, that such
  marked local distinctions as are found in other groups never
  existed in Chinese rugs. Such distinctions as do exist relate
  more to stages in development of the textile art, so that the
  natural classification is based on the successive periods when
  they were woven.</p>

  <p>The absence of written and traditional history regarding the
  weaving of these periods is by no means an insuperable obstacle
  to such classification. By a careful examination of large numbers
  of rugs, it is possible to arrange them with reasonable accuracy
  in series that represent progressive forms of ornamentation and
  design from the archaic to the modern. A most important aid to
  this arrangement is the interdependence so conspicuous in the
  several arts of China; for designs of innumerable articles with
  well-established ages, especially of the ceramic art, have been
  copied by the weavers.</p>

  <p>Technical peculiarities in weaving are also an aid in
  determining the period to which rugs belong. An important
  distinction, for instance, often exists in the manner in which
  the material is spun. If pieces of yarn be taken from old rugs
  and carefully examined, as they are untwisted, the simpler,
  cruder methods of spinning practised in former days are often
  apparent. In some of the oldest fabrics that remain the wool was
  very loosely spun. Irregularities in the size of yarn are also
  more noticeable in old than in modern pieces.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 60. Beluchistan
    Prayer Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>More important often in determining the relative age of a rug
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id=
  "Page_265">265</a></span>than either design or technical
  peculiarities of weaving, is the shade of colour; for however
  excellent were the original dyes and whatever care was exercised
  in their application, they slowly changed under the mellowing
  influence of time to tones that are obtained by no human process.
  Furthermore, as is the case with porcelains, certain colours were
  peculiar to certain periods. For instance, golden browns are seen
  mostly in pieces woven before the middle of the XVIII Century,
  and azure blue in pieces woven before the XIX Century. Yellow
  with a lemon or citron cast is found principally in pieces woven
  since the beginning of the XVIII Century; and green is rarely
  found in pieces woven before the middle of the XVIII Century.
  Aniline dyes were not introduced into China much before the year
  1870. The time when a rug was woven may safely be regarded as not
  more remote than the period when the ornamentation and designs it
  contains were generally adopted; yet it may be much more recent,
  as the oldest designs were copied even after the adoption of
  newer ones. It is necessary, then, in determining the age of a
  rug to consider not only the evidence of the spinning, the
  weaving and designs, but also the evidence of colour.</p>

  <p>Though Chinese rugs have features that distinguish them from
  other groups and divide them into separate classes; they also
  have many features in common. All are woven with the Sehna knot.
  In all but the earliest rugs the warp and weft are of cotton;
  each thread of warp is equally prominent at the back; and the
  weft, which is coarser than the warp, crosses twice between two
  rows of knots. The nap of both old and modern rugs is almost
  always wool or silk, and rarely, if ever, jute or cotton. The
  sides are finished by carrying the weft around the outer threads
  of warp, but never so as to form a wide selvage. The lower end,
  as a rule, has a very narrow web and warp loops; and the upper
  end has a narrow web and fringe. Compared with other groups they
  are generally more loosely woven. These and other features of
  resemblance and of distinction will be more fully noticed in
  considering the rugs of different periods.</p>

  <p>In rugs of this group are constantly seen symbols intimately
  associated with the religious and philosophic thought of China.
  One of them is the Sacred Mountain rising out of the waves of
  eternity, which is an old Chinese emblem, though more frequently
  found in rugs of Samarkand and Yarkand. Others are the cloud-band
  and the Joo-e. There are also mythical creatures, as the dragon,
  emblem of imperial power; the Ky-lin, partly deer, partly
  unicorn;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id=
  "Page_266">266</a></span> the Fung-Kwang or ph&oelig;nix; and the
  lion-dog. Still other symbolic and decorative designs are the
  figure Shou and the stork, emblems of longevity; the bat and
  butterfly, denoting happiness; the conch, wheel of law, and the
  two fishes, which are Buddhist emblems; and the lyre and chess
  board, which are symbols of the literati.</p>

  <p>It is not improbable that rugs were woven during the Sung
  dynasty (960-1280 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>), when for
  nearly three centuries prosperity prevailed, literature and art
  flourished, and the court at Hang Chow was maintained with
  imperial splendour; but as far as is known, none of them exist.
  Nor do any remain that may have been woven during the Yuan
  dynasty (1280-1370) distinguished by the reign of the illustrious
  Mongol prince, Kublai Khan; though designs appearing in later
  rugs were used in kindred arts of these and preceding
  periods.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Ming Rugs.</span>&mdash;The
  oldest Chinese rugs that remain were probably woven near the end
  of the Ming period, or during the first half of the XVII Century.
  It may reasonably be assumed that they were superior in quality
  to those of any former period, since during this time Persia and
  India were producing their greatest woven masterpieces; and other
  branches of Chinese art were marked by an advance over the work
  that had preceded. Yet, on the whole, it was a period of ebb in
  the splendid accomplishments of intellectual and artistic effort
  that marked the Tang and Sung dynasties.</p>

  <p>Such pieces as exist are distinguished by careful workmanship,
  archaic designs, and sobriety of colour. Most of the rugs were
  woven with warp and weft of cotton. Some, intended principally
  for wealthy mandarins or the imperial court, had pile of silk
  attached to warp and weft of cotton; and others were made
  entirely of silk. Fewer in number, but constituting the most
  sumptuous products of the Chinese weavers&rsquo; art, were the
  rugs of silk woven on a web of metal threads.</p>

  <p>The field of many of these early rugs contained all-over
  patterns. Sometimes the repeat designs are of octagonal shape and
  are arranged in horizontal and perpendicular lines, so as to
  leave small diamond-shaped spaces between diagonally placed
  octagons. Within these designs are often the emblems of happiness
  or longevity, floral motives, and sometimes archaic dragons. In
  another well-known pattern the field is completely covered with a
  swastika-fret and marked at regular intervals with diagonal rows
  of bats, emblematic of happiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span> Occasionally a field of
  plain colour contains an irregular arrangement of objects used
  for sacrificial or sacred purposes. Again, it may be covered with
  an all-over pattern of small archaically drawn dragons resembling
  some of the earliest designs in Chinese decorative art, or of
  most conventionalised floral forms on mechanically drawn
  stems.</p>

  <p>The essential feature, however, of a large number of these
  rugs, and one that probably antedates the all-over pattern, is a
  central medallion surrounded by a field that is either plain,
  that is marked with a subdued diaper pattern, or contains what is
  known as the &ldquo;tiger skin&rdquo; pattern, consisting of
  waving lines repeated throughout the field. The medallions may be
  either octagonal or, as is more frequently the case, rounded; but
  the defining lines are angular and generally represent frets.
  Sometimes they contain archaic dragons, which are so
  conventionalised in a few pieces that it is apparent that from
  them originated many of the Chinese scrolls. In other pieces, the
  shape of the central medallions and the designs which cover them
  suggest most forcibly that they were copied from old mirror
  backs. The corners of the fields may contain simple scrolls, but
  more frequently they correspond closely in drawing with the
  central medallions.</p>

  <p>The borders are equally typical. They are invariably narrow,
  and generally consist of a single stripe which is figured and
  surrounded with a coloured edging. Probably over three quarters
  of the rugs of this period have a stripe with a pattern of
  swastika-frets. Two of these stripes, which are very old
  patterns, are illustrated in Plate <a href="#pn">N</a>, Figs. 1
  and 2 (opp. Page 274). Occasionally some form of the key pattern
  appears in the inner stripe, but almost all Chinese rugs that
  have two border stripes with figures belong to a later period.
  Many of the oldest borders are without figured stripes, and
  consist merely of one or more stripes of plain colour.</p>

  <p>The few colours used in the rugs of this period have deep,
  rich tones. Undyed dark brown or blackish wool was occasionally
  used in the outer edging that surrounded the field or in the
  narrow border stripes; but more frequently the same colour effect
  was obtained by the use of corrosive dyes that in time have often
  eaten the wool almost to the foundation of warp and weft. Wools
  dyed with corrosive browns are also used in the fields and
  enhance the effect of designs of contrasting colours, which stand
  out in bold relief. Other colours, as soft dull yellow and shades
  of blue, are also seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268"
  id="Page_268">268</a></span> in the borders. The field is usually
  richer. In some pieces it is a deep red; in others it is a soft
  yellow, golden brown or yellowish tan, that shows the effect of
  time on what were originally several shades of apricot. Dark and
  light blues, sky blue, and robin&rsquo;s egg blue, as well as
  jade green and bottle green, are also found in these old pieces.
  In the metal and silk rugs the glint of silver even though
  tarnished, adds lustre to colours that have grown deeper and
  richer with age.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Kang-hi.</span>&mdash;During
  the first years of the Tsing dynasty, that continued from 1644 to
  its recent overthrow, the country was so occupied by wars waged
  between the conquering Manchoos and the still resisting followers
  of the Ming dynasty that art was nearly at a standstill. But
  during the reign of the illustrious Kang-hi, 1662-1722, art
  revived and enjoyed one of the most splendid periods of its
  history. There is, however, a noticeable difference between the
  rugs that belong to the early and to the late part of this reign;
  so that it is convenient to divide them into the early Kang-hi
  pieces, that were woven during the last part of the XVII Century,
  and the late Kang-hi pieces, almost all of which were woven at
  the beginning of the XVIII Century. This division is also
  convenient; as many rugs cannot be definitely assigned to the
  reign of a particular emperor, and, accordingly, the broader
  distinction of assigning them to different centuries is
  frequently adopted.</p>

  <p>In weaving, as in making porcelain, many of the products of
  the late Ming were still copied during the early Kang-hi period,
  but there was a freer use of colour and a more decorative
  ornamentation. Many of the figures are still geometric. Frets are
  conspicuous in the fields of large numbers of these pieces. The
  dragon also is a favourite motive; but in the scrolls that
  represent the legs and bifurcated tail, and in the
  conventionalised head, the resemblance to the mythical monster is
  almost lost. Sometimes two or more of these constitute a
  medallion in the centre of the field, in which others are grouped
  with regularity; while similar forms occupy the corners. Some of
  the rugs in which the fields are covered with sundry objects, as
  scrolls, vases, altar pieces, and sacred plants, also belong to
  this period. The borders of these and late Kang-hi pieces have
  frequently an outer edging of brown and a single border stripe
  with swastika-fret. In a few pieces, the stripe has a
  well-balanced scroll which has been developed from designs of
  conventionalised dragons and frets <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>that appear in the central
  medallion and in the corners of the field. Occasionally, however,
  there is an inner stripe with the key meander. The colour scheme
  of the late Ming, including the golden browns and deep blues, is
  largely employed in rugs of this period.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 61. Turkoman
    Saddle-bags</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>The same influences that resulted during the late Kang-hi
  period in the remarkable development of decorative art as applied
  to porcelains, produced a corresponding effect in the rugs woven
  at the same time. Manchurian ideas and taste gave renewed spirit
  to earlier Chinese style. The fields were not infrequently
  covered with sub-patterns of fret work, on which medallions
  appeared more prominently. The geometric figures were largely
  supplanted by foliate forms. Even when the central medallions and
  corner figures are of frets or stiffly conventionalised dragons,
  the fields are often covered with delicate scroll or foliate
  sub-patterns that support floral forms resembling the lotus or
  the peony. The drawing of some of these has a Western character,
  and there is little doubt that at this time the art of Persia had
  a strong influence on the weaving of China. In other pieces of
  this class, the foliate and floral forms no longer appear as
  sub-patterns but become the prominent feature in the decoration
  of the field; and the conventionalised flowers are arranged with
  precision in diagonal or perpendicular lines. To this period also
  belong rugs of a distinct type, in which the field represents a
  blending of pictorial and symbolic ideas, as, for instance, a
  homeward flight of swallows; or a grove where butterflies flit
  among the leaves, and deer with sacred fungus, emblematic of
  longevity, wander.</p>

  <p>The employment of border stripes of uniform colour was still
  continued, but there was a tendency to employ more elaborate
  designs in many of the figured stripes. It is not unusual to see
  single or double vines with conventionalised flowers; and though
  the drawing is mechanical, the relationship to Persian art is
  apparent. Yet in most of these pieces the swastika-fret is used.
  A noticeable difference also exists in the colour scheme of many
  of the late Kang-hi rugs, which frequently display brighter
  colours. Much of the yellow, for instance, contains more red,
  giving it a golden hue known as the &ldquo;imperial
  yellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Yung-ching.</span>&mdash;During
  the short reign of Yung-ching (1722-1736), though many of the old
  patterns were followed, the tendency to adopt more ornate forms
  begun during the first part of the XVIII Century continued.
  Manchurian ideas were now a strong factor<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span> in
  Chinese art, so that the use of colours and ornamentation
  followed broader lines. To this period are assigned most of those
  rugs in which designs are defined by lines of contrasting colour
  that has been so treated that the lines are depressed and throw
  the designs into bold relief. It is very difficult, however, to
  definitely determine that any particular rug belongs to this
  period; since the transition in colour scheme and patterns was
  gradual; and the effect of time on dyes, one of the most reliable
  factors in determining age, depends somewhat on their exposure to
  the elements and to use. But broadly speaking, figures of leaf
  and flower were more frequently adopted than in preceding periods
  and designs became less conventionalised and more artistic. Lemon
  and citron shades of yellow, also, became more prominent during
  this period.</p>

  <p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Keen-lung.</span>&mdash;The
  long reign of Keen-lung, lasting from 1736 to 1795, was one of
  the most prolific for Chinese art. To this period may safely be
  assigned most of the existing rugs made before the XIX Century,
  as well as many of the finest porcelains. The rugs partake of a
  more cosmopolitan character than those which had preceded; for
  not only are many of the designs and colours strictly Chinese,
  but others are of a Persian character, and others still suggest
  Mohammedan influences observable in the products of Turkestan and
  India. Moreover, many of the designs show a delicate shading that
  is not observable in the rugs made during the early part of the
  century. As a whole they are the most ornate of Chinese rugs.
  Woven after the inspiration of Persian masterpieces had left its
  strongest impress on Chinese weavers, and decoration in kindred
  arts had assumed a luxurious style, they represent in the drawing
  of leaf and flower, of birds, butterflies, and emblems of early
  philosophy and faith, and in the colours that blend with rare
  harmony, the most elaborate and voluptuous expression of native
  craftsmanship.</p>

  <p>In the best examples the geometric, and many of the stiff
  conventional forms which continued through the XVII and the early
  part of the XVIII Century, disappeared. In their place was a
  greater refinement of design, a greater accuracy of drawing,
  which found expression in floral forms that reached their highest
  development at this time and became characteristic of it.
  Occasionally they are represented in profile as is usually the
  practice in Western Asia, but more often are represented as
  viewed from above. Some of them, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>as chrysanthemums,
  peonies, sunflowers, and orchids, are most dainty and
  naturalistic. The fields of many of these pieces are covered with
  such flowers carefully arranged in harmonious groupings of leaf,
  bud and flower, but never with the formal and exact balance of
  old Persian carpets. Not infrequently mingled with them in the
  same piece are more conventional designs that belong to an
  earlier period; sometimes there is a single central medallion;
  and occasionally there are a large number of them. As a rule
  these medallions are entirely floral, and in rugs made during the
  latter part of this period they display elaborate ornamentation
  that distinguishes them from earlier ones; but now and then they
  contain fabulous creatures, as the lion-dogs, by which in a few
  instances they are entirely replaced.</p>

  <h4><i>COLOUR PLATE X&mdash;CHINESE RUG</i></h4>

  <p><i>Perfect technique of weaving, accuracy of drawing, and
  subdued rich colouring are the characteristics of this unusual
  piece. The knots of the fine woollen yarn are tied with a
  precision not frequently seen in Chinese rugs, and the shortness
  of nap discloses the faithfulness with which an artist of no
  ordinary ability has represented plants and flowers. Their soft
  tones stand out in relief against a background now darkened and
  enriched by the mellowing influence of time. Moreover, the
  motives of the upper and the lower half of the field, even to the
  minutest detail, show an exact balance. Many old Chinese rugs are
  of uncertain age, but this piece has been attributed, not without
  reason, to the Kang-hi period.</i></p>

    title="" />
  </div>

  <p>There are also many other well-known types of Keen-lung rugs.
  Surrounding the central medallion of some pieces are grouped the
  Taoist symbols; emblems of the literati, as chess boards,
  scrolls, and the lyre; as well as tripods, flower vases, fans of
  state, fruits of abundance, emblems of honours, and symbols of
  longevity and happiness. To this class also belong many of the
  pieces which have neither medallions nor corner pieces, but have
  fields completely covered with a pattern of continuous foliate
  stems and conventional flowers, repeated with exact precision of
  drawing. Likewise, in a few pieces the field is completely
  covered with an all-over pattern of small hexagonal or other
  geometric figures containing a conventionalised flower, strongly
  suggesting Turkoman influences. Some of the &ldquo;Grain of
  Rice&rdquo; rugs, also, were woven during this period.</p>

  <p>The borders are as distinctive as the fields. Only in a few
  pieces is the swastika meander seen, but in its place is often
  the T pattern. The key patterns represented in Plate <a href=
  "#pn">N</a>, Figs. 7 and 8 (opp. Page 274), as well as the dotted
  line (Fig. 22), are also largely employed. Almost all of these
  rugs have two ornamented stripes, and occasionally three, to
  which is added an outer margin of plain colour. In a few pieces
  both stripes are geometric; but generally one is floral and one
  geometric, in which case the wider, that, with very few
  exceptions, is the floral, is the inner one. Very rarely the
  border contains two floral stripes; and now and then Buddhist
  emblems and other devices are introduced.</p>

  <p>The breadth of artistic conception expressed in designs is
  accompanied by a wider scope of colour, in the use of which these
  rugs may conveniently be grouped in three subclasses. The first
  is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id=
  "Page_272">272</a></span> Blue and White, with ground of ivory or
  ashy white and designs that have shades of light or dark blue.
  The second comprises those in which the ground is some shade of
  yellow. Sometimes it has a tinge of lemon, orange, or apricot.
  Again it is what is known as dull, golden, mandarin, or imperial
  yellow. The overlying designs may contain a different shade of
  yellow from that of the field, an ivory white, a blue, or a red.
  The third subclass comprises those in which the ground colour is
  some shade of red; such as persimmon, terra cotta, crushed
  strawberry, apricot red, or a deep salmon pink, which is rare.
  The overlying designs may be a shade of blue, ivory white,
  yellow, gray, and even green. Colours of both field and border
  are sometimes the same but are more frequently complementary. As
  a whole, the elaborate designs, delicate shading, and rich
  colours rank these rugs among the most beautiful products of the
  Chinese loom.</p>

  <p>The rugs woven during the reigns of Kea-king (1796-1820) and
  Tao-Kwang (1821-1850), extending to the middle of last century,
  repeat with slight modification the patterns of the preceding
  period, though there is a tendency to use larger and coarser
  designs. The colours, too, are similar, yet they lack the deep
  richness that is matured only with the lapse of great time. Many
  of these rugs, as well as some woven still later, before the
  introduction of aniline dyes and factory processes, are
  beautiful; but as a rule the modern pieces lack the refinement of
  technique observable only in those produced before the beginning
  of the XIX Century.</p>

  <h4>MEDALLIONS</h4>

  <p>The study of medallions which occur in fields of Chinese rugs
  is not only interesting but is an important aid in determining
  their age; yet it should be remembered that approved patterns
  were often repeated even after the introduction of more elaborate
  styles. Many of the oldest medallions were copied from bronzes or
  mirror backs, and their drawing is geometric except as
  embellished by some conventionalised figures of the dragon. By a
  process of evolution these figures, in turn, were converted into
  scrolls, which in time were replaced by elaborate leaf and flower
  patterns.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pm">M</a>, Fig. 1 (opp. Page 272), is a
  &ldquo;Shou&rdquo; design of octagonal shape, copied from an old
  rug which was probably woven during the early part of the XVII
  Century.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate M. Medallions in
    Chinese Rugs</span></p>
  </div>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id=
  "Page_273">273</a></span></p>

  <p>Figs. 2, 3 and 4 of Plate <a href="#pm">M</a>, represent
  fret-covered medallions, which also are found in rugs of the same
  period. The first is probably the oldest pattern; and the last,
  to judge by the panel surrounding it, was apparently copied from
  a bronze mirror back.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pm">M</a>, Fig. 5, is a copy of a medallion
  similar to the one shown in Plate <a href="#pm">M</a>, Fig. 2,
  but with the dragons replaced by frets.</p>

  <p>A medallion of greater interest is illustrated in Plate
  <a href="#pm">M</a>, Fig. 6. It shows the evolution of scrolls
  from dragons, of which the heads alone betray their origin. Such
  medallions are found mostly in the earliest rugs.</p>

  <p>By comparing Fig. 7 of Plate <a href="#pm">M</a> with the
  preceding, it is apparent that its scrolls had a similar origin,
  but in this one the dragon heads have entirely disappeared. The
  design is characteristic of the early Kang-hi rugs.</p>

  <p>In Plate <a href="#pm">M</a>, Fig. 8, is represented a
  medallion that closely resembles some of the earliest period; but
  the more accurate drawing and clearer definition of lines shows
  that it is a later copy. It is found in late Kang-hi pieces.</p>

  <p>To this period, also, belongs the geometric pattern with
  swastikas represented in Plate <a href="#pm">M</a>, Fig. 9.</p>

  <p>Another medallion with frets and dragon heads is shown in
  Plate M, Fig. 10. The particular rug from which it was copied was
  probably woven about the Yung-ching period; but there is little
  doubt that similar medallions appeared in older rugs.</p>

  <p>In Figs. 11 and 12 of Plate <a href="#pm">M</a>, are
  represented two medallions with foliate designs that were largely
  employed in the early Keen-lung period. A comparison of the first
  with Fig. 13 of Plate <a href="#pm">M</a>, shows an interesting
  step in the evolution of the Chinese drawing.</p>

  <p>A very different medallion pattern of the same age is shown in
  Plate <a href="#pm">M</a>, Fig. 14, in which an encircling border
  consists of cloud-bands.</p>

  <p>Also during the Keen-lung time first appeared medallions with
  accurately drawn flower designs. One of this period is shown in
  Plate <a href="#pm">M</a>, Fig. 15. Wreath-like borders, such as
  are seen in this and the preceding one, are found in XVIII and
  XIX Century pieces.</p>

  <h4>CHINESE BORDER STRIPES</h4>

  <p>The knowledge that certain border stripes antedate others in
  definite sequence of time, is another aid in determining the age
  of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id=
  "Page_274">274</a></span> Chinese rugs. As was seen to be the
  case with medallions, the earliest stripes were purely geometric.
  In others, still very old, appeared forms of conventionalised
  dragons, which again were replaced by simple scrolls and these by
  ornate floral forms. But it should be remembered that earlier
  designs were often copied in later rugs, so that the evidence of
  age is merely contributory.</p>

  <p>Stripes containing the swastika meander were used almost
  exclusively in the oldest rugs. Figs. 1, 2, and 3 of Plate
  <a href="#pn">N</a> (opp. Page 274), represent three old forms,
  which rarely appear in any pieces woven since the Kang-hi time.
  The pattern of Plate <a href="#pn">N</a>, Fig. 4, in which
  alternate swastikas are reversed, is also very old.</p>

  <p>The usual drawing of the swastika stripe is shown in Plate
  <a href="#pn">N</a>, Fig. 5. It is found largely in Kang-hi rugs,
  and if used in more recent fabrics, is often accompanied by a
  stripe with some other pattern. As illustrated here, the facing
  of the swastika is reversed in the middle of the stripe.</p>

  <p>The shading of Plate <a href="#pn">N</a>, Fig. 6, which is
  somewhat similar to Plate <a href="#pn">N</a>, Fig. 4, is
  characteristic of the Keen-lung and subsequent periods.</p>

  <p>In Figs. 7, 8, 9, and 10, of Plate <a href="#pn">N</a>, are
  Key and T patterns, which are found in rugs of the Kang-hi and
  subsequent periods, but rarely in earlier pieces. When employed
  in rugs woven later than the middle of the XVIII Century they are
  often shaded. These meander and key-patterns are of great
  antiquity; and though the drawing is exceedingly simple, it is
  supposed that the figures from which they were derived once
  symbolised clouds and thunder.</p>

  <p>A very interesting stripe derived from dragons is illustrated
  in Plate <a href="#pn">N</a>, Fig. 11. The rectangular frets
  represent bodies of which conventionalised heads alone betray
  their origin. The graceful scroll in the middle was also probably
  derived from dragon forms. This stripe is seen in old Kang-hi
  rugs.</p>

  <p>The rectangular frets and floral forms are combined in an
  unusual stripe (Plate <a href="#pn">N</a>, Fig. 12) that appeared
  in rugs which were probably woven about the Yung-ching period. It
  shows the influence of older traditions on which are ingrafted
  the later inspiration.</p>

  <p>Still more interesting is a stripe (Plate <a href="#pn">N</a>,
  Fig. 13) seen in what are known as Buddhist rugs of the Keen-lung
  period. In different parts of the border appear the Buddhist
  emblems, the Joo-e, conch, wheel of law, and knot of destiny,
  separated by cloud-bands and foliate and floral motives.</p>

  <p>The tendency to use more ornate forms in the Keen-lung and
  later rugs is shown in Plate <a href="#pn">N</a>, Figs. 14, 15,
  and 16, which illustrate three stripes that with slight
  modifications are found in large numbers of Chinese rugs of the
  last half of the XVIII and the XIX Centuries.</p>

  <p>The stripe illustrated in Plate <a href="#pn">N</a>, Fig. 17,
  on which are represented halves of octagonal discs containing
  conventional flower forms, is found in some rugs woven as early
  as the first part of the XVIII Century, as well as in more
  subsequent pieces. The central fields of some rugs in which it is
  found have geometric Ming patterns, and others have floral
  conceits that suggest Persian influences.</p>

  <p>In Figs. 18, 19, 20, and 21, of Plate <a href="#pn">N</a>, are
  represented simple stripes found in XVIII Century rugs. The last
  of these, which is found in Keen-lung porcelain, shows a marked
  resemblance to the reciprocal trefoil so common in Persian
  pieces.</p>

  <p>The simple dotted stripe (Plate <a href="#pn">N</a>, Fig. 22)
  was rarely employed before the middle of the XVIII Century, but
  has been constantly used since then.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

  <h4>KILIMS</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/k.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="K"
  title="K" /></span>ILIMS have a special interest apart from their
  beauty and utility, as some of them undoubtedly resemble the
  early fabrics of the Egyptians and Babylonians from which were
  evolved the more durable pile carpets. The different links in
  this evolution can only be conjectured. Yet it is not unlikely
  that such pieces as the nomadic kilims, which occasionally have
  little tufts of wool attached for ornament or loose threads of
  weft hanging from one side, first suggested the greater
  durability and warmth that would be derived from a woven fabric
  completely covered with tufts of yarn.</p>

  <p>It is also certain that the most delicately woven kilims have
  likewise been evolved from cruder forms. In fact, the different
  steps in this evolution correspond to three separate styles of
  weaving still in vogue. The earliest products which were made
  subsequent to the primitive weaving of uncoloured warp and weft
  were doubtless similar to the simple fabrics now used to line the
  under side of saddle bags, and consisted of a warp and weft of
  uniformly coloured threads. A much more advanced style, induced
  by a desire for ornamentation, was the representation of patterns
  which required the use of different coloured threads of weft. As
  these threads were never carried beyond the edges of each
  pattern, their loose ends were at first allowed to hang at the
  back, giving an appearance somewhat similar to what is seen in
  Soumaks. The third and most finished style, representing much
  higher workmanship, was produced by deftly disposing of the ends
  of threads of weft so that they should be concealed and thus
  permit each surface of the kilim to be exactly the same.</p>

  <p>Each of these kinds of weaving is constantly seen in the East.
  The first not only is used as a lining for saddle bags, but is
  frequently substituted for them. It is also sometimes used as the
  only floor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id=
  "Page_277">277</a></span> covering, or again is laid as a
  protection beneath valuable carpets. It often replaces the
  heavier felt for tents, and indeed is utilised for all purposes
  requiring a strong material like canvas. The second is found
  among nomadic weavers, especially those of Asia Minor; who
  naturally waste no unnecessary labour in weaving kilims with a
  delicate finish, which would be quickly marred by the rough usage
  that they receive. The third, which is the more elegant product,
  is invariably not only of excellent finish but of carefully drawn
  patterns. In this country, the last two are used principally for
  portieres and couch coverings; but in the Orient they still
  serve, as they have from the remotest times, for floor coverings;
  and because of the custom of removing the shoes when entering a
  house, last for a great many years.</p>

  <p>Though these three styles represent the principal variations
  in kilim weaving, there are a few pieces with embroidered
  pattern; and embroidered stitches are sometimes added to
  represent some simple design, or as is frequently the case in
  Shirvans, to make more prominent the separate horizontal
  compartments.</p>

  <p>When weaving a kilim, the threads of warp are strung as in
  piled rugs, and number from six to eighteen to the inch according
  to the texture. There are generally about twenty threads of weft
  to the inch, measured at the front or back; but in pieces of the
  finest workmanship, there may be as many as fifty, and in the
  crudest only eight or nine. At the sides of the kilim, the
  threads of weft encircle the last thread of warp as at the sides
  of any pattern; but at the ends, the threads of warp are braided
  about a heavier added cord, or else are tied in knots, from which
  their loose ends are permitted to hang like tassels.</p>

  <p>The patterns are usually geometric; and even when an attempt
  is made to copy floral figures, the drawing inclines to the
  rectilinear. If a straight line representing the side of a figure
  is horizontal, or in the direction of the weft, it will often be
  several inches in length; but a straight perpendicular line never
  exceeds an inch in length. This is because the threads of weft
  are never carried from one pattern to another or to the adjoining
  field, but are turned back at its defining edges, so that an
  opening is left, which would impair the strength of the fabric if
  it were of much length. Accordingly, if it is desired to
  represent a pattern with perpendicular sides, it is necessary
  that the edges be slightly uneven. But here necessity is turned
  to advantage, as this unevenness or fringing softens
  lines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id=
  "Page_278">278</a></span> that otherwise would be harsh. Defining
  the outlines of many figures is yarn of different colours, which
  either may be woven like other threads of weft, or when it serves
  the purpose of closing the space between adjacent threads of
  warp, may be attached by stitches. Borders find slight favour
  with kilim weavers, and in most pieces they are entirely wanting
  or only present at one end. Even when they completely surround
  the field, there is generally some difference in design or colour
  between the stripes of side and end. Prayer arches are found in
  some of the kilims, but their outlines rarely correspond closely
  with those of piled rugs.</p>

  <p>The colours, by which alone the patterns are distinguished,
  are largely responsible for the character of the kilim. Threads
  of weft of every hue that is seen in piled rugs are employed in
  these pieces; yet the colouring never appears the same, since
  there are lacking the lustre and deep wealth of tones due to the
  length of pile, in which appears an almost imperceptible
  gradation from the ends that are exposed to the light and have
  incurred the mellowing influence of the elements to the part
  which retains more of the original colours and seems darker,
  because it is more concealed. Indeed, on account of the lack of
  pile, the colours and patterns would seem harsh were it not for
  the irregularities of perpendicular and diagonal lines, the
  devices of latch-hooks, and other peculiarities that convey to
  the eye an impression of blending. Moreover when the designs are
  large, the effect of the colour is always severe; but when the
  field is covered with innumerable small figures, it is greatly
  softened.</p>

  <p>As kilims are much less durable than rugs that have a pile to
  protect the warp and weft, it is not surprising that few of great
  age remain. The oldest piece of which we have any knowledge is a
  fragment obtained by Dr. M. A. Stein, the arch&aelig;ological
  explorer, from the ruins near Khotan, in Eastern Turkestan, of an
  ancient settlement, which was buried by sand drifts about the
  fourth or fifth century <i>anno domini</i>. The weave is almost
  identical with that of modern kilims, and has about fourteen
  threads of warp and sixteen threads of weft to the inch. The
  pattern consists of narrow stripes of blue, green, brownish
  yellow, and red, containing very small geometric designs. With
  this one exception, so peculiarly preserved, there are probably
  very few over a century old.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Though kilims are now made in most of the districts where
  piled carpets are woven, very few classes are recognised. This
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id=
  "Page_279">279</a></span>is because it is difficult to
  distinguish between most of them, and such differences as exist
  are with few exceptions unimportant. The best known classes are
  the Sehna, Shirvan, Karaman, Kurdish, Turkish, and Merv.</p>

  <p>The Sehna kilims are usually of small size, and rarely exceed
  a breadth of four and a half feet and a length of seven. They are
  far superior to all others in the delicacy of colour, daintiness
  of design, quality of material, and character of workmanship.
  Their patterns, including border, are identical with those of the
  piled rugs; and the colours, to which at a short distance the
  small figures of the Herati design give the effect of blending,
  are the same. As is not the case with other kilims, the warp is
  of cotton or linen and there are generally from fourteen to
  sixteen threads to the inch. The weft is of wool, and to an inch
  there are often nearly fifty threads encircling a thread of warp
  as they cross and recross. The old pieces, like the rugs of which
  they are true copies, are rapidly becoming scarce. They resemble
  tapestries and are unfit for hard usage.</p>

  <p>A large percentage of the kilims now sold in this country are
  Shirvans. Their fields are divided into a number of parallel
  horizontal compartments or bands a foot or more in width
  separated by narrower bands. Not infrequently the principal
  figures of the wide bands are hexagons surrounding smaller
  geometric figures; and through the more narrow bands runs a
  waving line or a parti-coloured cord. Another peculiarity,
  occasionally seen, are the ray-like projections of uniform colour
  fringing the edges of the sides. As a rule, there are no borders,
  but at each end are two or more narrow bands that give the effect
  of a border. In some pieces webs of plain colour extend beyond
  the bands; and the ends are fringed with loose threads of warp.
  The colours are always pronounced, because of lack of shading,
  and consist mostly of red, blue, and ivory. Yellow and green are
  also used. These kilims are much heavier than the Sehnas, and
  also larger, as the average size is about five by nine feet; and
  some are even seven by twelve feet.</p>

  <p>From the district of Karaman in Southern Asia Minor, such a
  large number of kilims were formerly imported into Europe that
  the general name of Karamani was applied to all kilims. They are
  still made there by many of the tribes of Turkish or Turkoman
  origin, who wander over the Taurus mountains, and like all their
  fabrics are stoutly woven. Their average size is about four and a
  half by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id=
  "Page_280">280</a></span> eight feet. In colours and patterns,
  they resemble many of the Kurdish kilims from the districts
  farther to the east.</p>

  <p>A distinction similar to what exists in the piled rugs of the
  Kurds, and dependent on the district in which they are made, is
  observable in their kilims, as those which come from the Persian
  border have carefully drawn designs, that are generally lacking
  in others woven in the mountainous watershed of the Tigris and
  the Euphrates. Many of these are coarsely woven, and from the
  back hang the loose ends of threads of weft, that in more
  artistic pieces, are removed. Moreover, in modern pieces the
  colours are often crude or even garish. Some of the kilims have
  large diamond-shaped figures containing small designs; others
  have horizontal bands in which are woven embroidered devices
  suggestive of the so-called Bagdad portieres; in many are wide
  spaces without designs; but whatever the pattern, there is
  usually a parti-coloured cord running through the web at the
  end.</p>

  <p>In many parts of Asia Minor are made kilims that are usually
  classed as Turkish. They are of large size, and since they are
  used mostly for portieres or curtains, are divided
  perpendicularly into equal halves, that at times are united by
  stitches. The tribes that make them also make large numbers of
  smaller prayer kilims with pointed arches suggesting the Ghiordes
  design. Some of them are beautifully woven, yet the finest
  workmanship is shown in pieces known as &ldquo;Kis-kilims&rdquo;
  or girl&rsquo;s kilims. These are made with the utmost care,
  since they are intended as a bride&rsquo;s gift to her husband;
  and a sentiment of romance, and the hope that her skill may weigh
  favourably in the estimation of her accomplishments, contribute
  to influence the weaver. Sometimes even a lock of hair is added
  as a charm, or coloured beads as a talisman.</p>

  <p>The Christians who live permanently about Oushak, and are,
  accordingly, not under the necessity of making such small pieces
  as can conveniently be carried by wandering tribes, weave some of
  the largest kilims. Most of them are at least six feet in width
  and many are much wider.</p>

  <p>The best known kilims from the Central Asiatic group are known
  as &ldquo;Merv Kilims,&rdquo; since they are woven by Turkoman
  tribes who inhabit the desert near the old capital of Merv. The
  brilliant colours found in the products of more Western tribes
  are entirely wanting, and in their place are the few subdued,
  rich tones so characteristic of all Turkoman weavings. These
  pieces are stoutly woven, and<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span> since the pattern is
  represented by diagonal lines, there is no open work. The designs
  are largely of diamond-shape, and are arranged in parallel
  horizontal lines on a field that is usually surrounded by a
  border profusely ornamented with carefully drawn latch-hooks. A
  heavy embroidered selvage, from which hang loose threads of warp,
  often occurs at the ends. These kilims are noted for their
  durability, and are usually of large size.</p>

  <p>In the city of Dera Ghazi Khan, four miles from the Indus
  river, are woven kilims in which warp and weft are of wool, as is
  not the case with almost all the rugs of India. They are made by
  the women in their own homes and display an individuality which
  also is rare in Indian textile fabrics. In a monograph on
  &ldquo;Carpet Weaving in the Punjab,&rdquo; Mr. C. Latimer says:
  &ldquo;The Dera Ghazi Khan rug, which belongs really to the kind
  of fabrics known as kilims, is woven in stripes, with designs
  between them, and it is interesting to notice that the patterns
  employed were by local tradition originally copied from the robes
  of the Pharaohs of Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Though all such Oriental weavings lack the precision of
  drawing and the delicacy of minutely varied colour so frequently
  found in piled rugs; though they never display high, artistic
  perception or poetic instinct, nevertheless some of the oldest
  pieces with designs suggestive of the workings of a primitive
  imagination untrammelled by the conventions of art, and with a
  chaste simplicity of colour that lends an atmosphere of dignity,
  possess a subtle charm that awakens an intense interest.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

  <h4>HOW TO DISTINGUISH RUGS</h4>

  <p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/t.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="T"
  title="T" /></span>HE owner of an Oriental rug will find the
  pleasure to be derived from it will be greater if he knows where
  and by whom it was made. This is particularly true if it is one
  of those pieces of which the charm depends more on its
  individuality than on the masterly handling of line and colour.
  The study of classification, therefore, will well repay the
  effort; though unfortunately it is often discouraging, since it
  involves a consideration of the characteristics of a hundred
  different classes, almost all of which are found to have
  exceptions to the best known types. To add to the difficulty, the
  opinions of dealers in regard to the less known classes are very
  often erroneous; and detailed descriptions, even at the best, are
  unsatisfactory. Without a long personal experience in handling
  rugs, combined with careful study, it is impossible to become
  expert; but familiarity with one class makes it easier by
  comparison and a process of elimination to distinguish
  others.</p>

  <p>The beginner should first learn to identify each of the six
  groups. Of these the Chinese can readily be distinguished by
  their well-known patterns, which are found in no other part of
  the Orient except in the rugs known as Samarkands, Yarkands, and
  Kashgars; and the Indian may generally be recognised by the
  realism and formal arrangement of their floral patterns.
  Relatively few of either group are found in the United States;
  and as about ninety per cent of the rugs belong to the other four
  groups, they alone will be considered in detail. Leaving out of
  consideration, then, the Chinese and Indian rugs, it should be
  remembered:</p>

  <p class="indent3">(<i>a</i>) That, as a rule, rugs from Persia
  have floral patterns; and rugs from Asia Minor, Caucasia, and
  Central Asia have geometric.</p>

  <p class="indent3">(<i>b</i>) That figures with latch-hooks
  belong principally to rugs of the Caucasian group and, to a
  limited extent, to the rugs of the Asia Minor group.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 63. XVIII Century
    Chinese Rug</span></p>
  </div>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id=
  "Page_283">283</a></span></p>

  <p class="indent3">(<i>c</i>) That fields covered with designs of
  octagonal or diamond shape belong to rugs of the Central Asian
  group.</p>

  <p class="indent3">(<i>d</i>) That about two thirds of the
  Persian group have cotton warp; and the remaining third, as well
  as the Asia Minor and almost all the Caucasian and Central Asian
  group have woollen warp.</p>

  <p class="indent3">(<i>e</i>) That about one third of the Persian
  group have one of the two threads of warp encircled by a knot
  doubled under the other so as to be hidden at the back; and that
  this is not the case with the remaining two thirds nor with
  almost all classes of other groups.</p>

  <p class="indent3">(<i>f</i>) That, with few exceptions, the
  Persian rugs have a side finish of overcasting; and the other
  groups have both overcasting and selvage.</p>

  <p class="indent3">(<i>g</i>) That the rugs from Persia and
  Central Asia have both light and dark colours which, though rich,
  are subdued and harmonious; that the rugs of Asia Minor and
  Caucasia have colours that are often gaudy and inharmonious; and
  that the rugs of the Central Asian group have dark tones of red,
  blue, and brown.</p>

  <p class="indent3">(<i>h</i>) That all of the rugs of Asia Minor
  and Caucasia have the Ghiordes knot; that the rugs of Central
  Asia, with rare exceptions, have the Sehna knot; that the rugs of
  Persia with woollen warp have the Ghiordes knot; and that those
  with cotton warp have either the Ghiordes or the Sehna knot.</p>

  <p class="indent3">(<i>i</i>) That the few classes of rugs which
  have very long end-webs belong to the Central Asian group. Of the
  classes with moderately long end-webs, several belong to the
  Central Asian and the Asia Minor groups, only two belong to the
  Persian group, and none belongs to the Caucasian group.</p>

  <p>Excluding the Indian and Chinese rugs, it follows from the
  above statements that:</p>

<table summary="carpet groups">
<tr>
<td class="left"><p class="indent4">(1) A rug is from Persia or Central

</table>

  <p>Of these four groups the Persian has the largest number of
  classes, some of which can only with difficulty be distinguished
  from one another. They may, however, conveniently be divided into
  the following sub-groups, depending on the technical
  peculiarities of the weaving and the material of the warp, so
  that the task of learning the class of a particular rug will be
  greatly facilitated by first determining to which of these
  sub-groups it belongs, and then eliminating the others from
  consideration.</p>

  <p>Of the sub-groups represented on Page 284, &ldquo;A&rdquo;
  includes those that have the closest and finest woven texture. In
  this respect the Kashans, Sarouks, and Kirmans are, in the order
  named, superior to the others; and the Kermanshahs are the
  coarsest and the least evenly woven. In sub-group &ldquo;B&rdquo;
  the Tabriz are the best woven and have the shortest nap. The
  Gorevans and Serapis have several concentric medallions, in which
  are designs of archaically drawn <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>leaves, and have generally
  the so-called turtle border. The Herats have the typical Herati
  border. Of the classes of sub-group &ldquo;C,&rdquo; the Royal
  Sarabends are the closest woven. The Feraghans are slightly
  coarser and the Mahals and Muskabads are much coarser and have
  longer nap. The Luristans, Joshaghans, and Gulistans are the best
  woven of sub-group &ldquo;D.&rdquo; At the back of Luristans each
  half knot is distinct from the other like a separate bead; and in
  a few Joshaghans each half knot is almost as distinct. Both Irans
  and Sultanabads are coarsely woven. Comparing sub-groups
  &ldquo;E&rdquo; and &ldquo;F,&rdquo; the weave of Sehnas presents
  a file-like appearance at the back; and in Hamadans the weft is
  of much coarser diameter than in the other two classes. The
  Bijars of sub-group &ldquo;G&rdquo; are much stouter than the
  Niris and have one of the two threads of weft to each knot more
  completely doubled under the other. The webs at the ends of the
  Niris are very much longer than those of Bijars. Sub-group
  &ldquo;H&rdquo; contains the Kurdistans, Suj-Bulaks and Mosuls,
  all of which are woven in territory where for generations the
  Kurds have held sway, and show Kurdish characteristics. The
  Western Kurdistans may easily be distinguished by their brown
  colours, nomadic character, and coarse warp and weft. The Persian
  Kurdistans are very stoutly and firmly woven, and usually have
  one of the two threads of warp encircled by a knot depressed
  below the other. The Mosuls have each of the two threads of warp
  encircled by a knot equally prominent at the back; and a
  characteristic feature is the coloured, crudely spun yarn of
  weft, which on account of the size of its diameter stands up as
  high as the yarn of the knots at the back. In a typical Suj-Bulak
  the alignment of knots at the back appears uneven or serrated.
  The Karadaghs have Caucasian characteristics; the Afshars have
  coarse, wiry wool for the weft, and threads of warp strung so
  that each half knot is distinct.</p>

  <p>Although the technicalities of weaving are the most reliable
  evidence for determining the class to which a rug belongs, the
  patterns are important guides. It will be well, therefore, to
  remember that:</p>

  <p>A Persian rug is probably a Shiraz, Karadagh, Karaje, Mosul,
  Kurdistan, or Afshar, if the pattern is partly geometric.</p>

  <p>If the field has concentric medallions, the rug may be a
  Kermanshah, Sarouk, Kashan, Sehna, Gorevan, Herez, Tabriz, Mahal,
  Muskabad, or Sultanabad.</p>

  <p>If the field is covered with pear designs, the rug may be a
  Sarabend, Burujird, Khorassan, Shiraz, Niris, Iran, Joshaghan, or
  Luristan.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id=

  <p>If the field is covered with small Herati designs, the rug may
  be a Feraghan, Sehna, or an Iran.</p>

  <p>If the field is covered with small designs of the Guli Hinnai
  plant, the rug may be a Feraghan.</p>

  <p>If the field is covered with the Mina Khani pattern, the rug
  may be a Persian Kurdistan.</p>

  <p>A Persian rug is usually a Shiraz, Niris, Mosul, or Kurdistan
  if the nap is long.</p>

  <p>It is almost invariably either a Shiraz or a Niris if the webs
  of the ends are long, and the overcasting of the sides has a
  barber-pole design or has short lengths of different colours. The
  Niris resembles the Shiraz; but one thread of warp to each knot
  is more depressed, the ends generally have longer webs, and the
  field is more frequently covered with large pear designs. It is a
  Shiraz if short tassels or tufts project at regular intervals
  from the ends; and it is probably a Niris if it has a long
  end-web of different coloured stripes.</p>

  <p>It is probably a Karadagh, Gorevan, Serapi, Herez, or Tabriz
  if the sides are finished with a selvage.</p>

  <p>Many of these classes have features by which they can be
  distinguished at once from all others. For instance:</p>

  <p>The Sarabend has a field completely covered with pear designs
  of moderate size facing in opposite directions in alternate
  lines; borders of several stripes, of which one or two are ivory
  white with an angular vine from which are suspended mechanically
  drawn pear designs, and one or two narrow stripes with reciprocal
  trefoils. Only two other classes are similar: the Iran copies,
  which are always woven more coarsely and have the Ghiordes knot,
  and the Burujirds, which are rarely seen.</p>

  <p>Most Feraghans have fields that are completely covered with
  small Herati or Guli Hinnai designs, and have the turtle pattern
  in the border. The only other rugs that are similar are the Iran
  copies, which have the Ghiordes knot and are more coarsely
  woven.</p>

  <p>Almost all Hamadans may be distinguished at once by the broad
  band of camel&rsquo;s hair surrounding the border, and the coarse
  weft crossing only once between two rows of knots so as to give a
  quincunx effect at the back.</p>

  <p>Gorevans are invariably of carpet size. They have fields
  almost covered with central medallions on which are archaically
  drawn leaves, and a broad central border stripe with a large
  conventionalised turtle pattern. They have usually the same
  colour tones,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id=
  "Page_288">288</a></span> which once seen are not forgotten. The
  Serapis are similar to Gorevans but are usually older and of
  better colours.</p>

  <p>The Kermanshahs have tones of ivory, pink, and light green,
  that are softer and lighter than those of almost any other rug.
  The fields have concentric medallions with dainty floral forms
  that are rarely seen in other classes except the Sarouks and
  Kashans; and the borders, that correspond in drawing and
  colouring with the field, have an outer edging that is almost
  invariably of pink, but sometimes dark blue. The drawing and
  colours, which are not easily described but quickly learned, at
  once distinguish these pieces from all others.</p>

  <p>Some Mesheds resemble Kermanshahs, but the nap is more silky,
  uneven, and lustrous. The texture at the back is finer.</p>

  <p>The rugs of Tabriz, which are usually made in carpet sizes,
  may be distinguished by their linen nap hanging in a short fringe
  at the ends. They are not likely to be confused with any classes
  but the Mesheds, Khorassans, and Kermanshahs; but the nap is
  shorter, and harsher to the touch; the knot is Ghiordes, and the
  drawing more formal.</p>

  <p>Almost the only Persian rug that has small, geometric,
  adventitious designs and latch-hooks is the Shiraz. It is the
  only one that has small tufts of wool projecting from the sides;
  and with the exception of the Niris is the only one that, as a
  rule, has a barber-pole overcasting and a long web at the ends.
  It is also one of the most loosely woven.</p>

  <p>The Sarouk and Kashan may be distinguished from all others by
  their short velvety nap; dark rich colours; fields of graceful
  foliated stalks and floral forms resting on concentric
  medallions; and the fine, firm, texture of the weave. A carefully
  drawn design of the running latch-hook appears in the borders;
  and the weft is usually some shade of blue. The Kashans are
  almost the same as Sarouks but have closer weave and finer
  texture. They very rarely come in large sizes.</p>

  <p>Muskabads and Mahals are invariably made in large carpet
  sizes. Their texture is firm; they are very coarsely woven; and
  there is great irregularity in the size of the knots as shown at
  the back. Of the two, the Mahals are the better grade.</p>

  <p>A large rug with woollen warp and with one thread of warp to
  each knot doubled under the other is almost always a Bijar.</p>

  <p>Sehnas are always very thin rugs and of small or moderate
  size. With few exceptions the field is covered with Herati or
  pear designs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id=
  "Page_289">289</a></span> They can be identified by the quincunx
  appearance of the fine cotton weft at the back and the file-like
  feeling of the weave.</p>

  <p>The only Persian rug that has a side selvage and also shows
  evidence of Caucasian influence in the geometric drawing of the
  patterns is the Karadagh.</p>

  <p>The Gozenes may be distinguished from other classes by their
  dull colours. In many of them each thread of warp is encircled by
  the right half of some knots and the left half of others.</p>

  <p class="tb">The Asia Minor rugs have so many features in common
  that they cannot conveniently be divided into sub-groups. For
  instance: almost all have a coloured weft, a coloured web with
  fringe at the ends, and a selvage at the sides; all, excepting
  the Ghiordes and a few modern pieces, have woollen warp and weft;
  and all have the Ghiordes knot. To be sure, a distinction may be
  made in the length of the nap, since as a rule the Bergamo,
  Rhodian, Karaman, Yuruk, and some of the Anatolians have a long
  nap; and the remainder usually have a short nap; and also in the
  weaving, as in the Bergamo, Ghiordes, Karaman, Kulah, and Ladik,
  one thread of warp to each knot is generally depressed, and in
  the remaining classes all threads of warp are equally prominent;
  furthermore, Anatolians, Bergamos, Karamans, Rhodians, and
  Koniehs, have rarely more than three stripes to the border; and
  Kir-Shehrs, Kulahs, Ladiks, and Ghiordes have seldom less than
  five; but these features are not always constant and pronounced.
  The patterns, therefore, and those smaller designs which
  frequently are peculiar to a single class are of considerable
  assistance in distinguishing one from the other. The arch of the
  namazliks is also an invaluable feature for identification since
  its shape is different in each class as will be seen by reference
  to Plates C and D (Pages 61 and 63).</p>

  <p>Leaving out of consideration modern pieces, made to meet the
  demands of exporting companies, the Bergamo and Rhodian have
  certain points of resemblance. As a rule, they are almost square,
  and have long nap, long webs with coloured bands at the ends, a
  side selvage, and coloured weft. The Rhodian may generally be
  distinguished by their brighter colours and their panels,
  suggesting windows, placed parallel to the length of the rug. The
  Bergamos, which are more frequently seen, have rich, deep blue
  and red colouring, and more devices to avert the evil eye than
  any other Oriental rug.</p>

  <p>Two panels, one above the arch and the other below the
  field,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id=
  "Page_290">290</a></span> are almost invariably seen in the
  Ghiordes prayer rugs and occasionally in the Kulahs, but rarely
  in any other classes. The typical pattern of the central border
  stripe of Ghiordes prayer rugs, consisting of most
  conventionalised leaf and rosette, is not seen in any other rugs;
  nor is the pattern of the broad border stripe of the odjaliks and
  sedjadehs, consisting of an undulating band covered with small
  flecks and fringed with latch-hooks.</p>

  <p>The most characteristic features in the pattern of Kulahs are
  the numerous narrow fleck-covered bands that occupy the centre of
  the border, and the secondary stripe with design like a Chinese
  device represented in <a href="#ph">Plate H</a>, Fig. 10 (opp.
  Page 194).</p>

  <p>The pomegranates at the end of the field, and the Rhodian
  lilies in the main stripe of the border, distinguish Ladik prayer
  rugs from all others. Figures of vandykes, which are seen in some
  Anatolians and Mudjars, are also a constant feature of
  Ladiks.</p>

  <p>A characteristic feature of Koniehs is the row of sprigs with
  three triangular-shaped petals that project from the border
  against the field.</p>

  <p>As a rule, the Kir-Shehrs contain in the field a larger amount
  of grass-green colour than any other rug.</p>

  <p>The narrow border stripe of thumb-like processes that fit one
  another like cogs and the mauve or heliotrope colour are
  important aids in distinguishing Melez rugs.</p>

  <p>On account of their long pile and their patterns of
  latch-hooks and other geometric figures, the Yuruks alone of all
  this group resemble the Caucasian rugs. They may also be
  distinguished from other Asia Minor rugs by the facts that the
  weft is of coarse, wiry wool, and the threads of warp are not
  strung closely together, so that at the back each half knot
  appears very distinct from the other.</p>

  <p class="tb">A similarity prevails in the technique of most
  Caucasian rugs, as all have the Ghiordes knot, and almost all
  have warp and weft of wool, sides that are selvaged, and ends
  with a web and loose fringe. Moreover, classes that are in a
  measure geographically related show resemblances, as for
  instance: the Chichi, Daghestan, Kabistan, and Shirvan, which
  have short nap; the Tcherkess, Kazak, and Genghas which have
  medium to long nap; and the Soumak, Shemakha, and Kuba, which
  have a similar selvage at sides and ends. The only classes in
  which one thread of warp to each knot is depressed or doubled
  under the other are the Karabagh, Shemakha, and Shusha, from the
  southeastern part of Caucasia, and the Lesghian from the northern
  part.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id=
  "Page_292">292</a></span>The Soumak with its flat stitch and with
  ends of yarn hanging loose at the back is unlike all other rugs.
  At the sides is a carefully woven selvage, and next to the nap at
  the end is a narrow selvage of fine spun threads. The rugs of
  Shemakha, woven by some of the same tribes who dwell nearer the
  mountains, have similar selvages at the sides of blue or bluish
  green, similar ends of a narrow web of &ldquo;herring-bone&rdquo;
  weave and one or more rows of knots, and a medium long nap of
  rich blues, reds, yellows, browns, and greens. The Kuba rugs are
  almost identical with them, except that each thread of warp is
  equally prominent at the back, whereas in the Shemakhas one
  thread to each knot is depressed. When once these selvages, the
  narrow end-webs of &ldquo;herring-bone&rdquo; weave, and the
  particular tones of colour characteristic of these rugs have been
  carefully observed, they are not forgotten. The well-known
  Georgian stripe (Plate <a href="#pj">J</a>, Fig. 9, opp. Page
  228) is rarely found in any but these three classes.</p>

  <p>The Baku rug may be distinguished by its geometric-shaped pear
  designs, and stiffly drawn birds. If modern, the tones are
  dull.</p>

  <p>Long, shaggy nap, strong colours, of which red and green are
  almost invariably present, and large designs surrounded by
  numerous small nomadic figures are the general features of a
  Kazak. The Tcherkess has a striking resemblance to it, so that
  they are constantly mistaken for one another; but the Tcherkess
  is generally better woven and the pattern usually consists of
  what is known as the &ldquo;Sunburst&rdquo; resting on a field of
  dull red or a tawny shade. The border is almost invariably of
  three stripes, of which the central has the tarantula design, and
  the two guards have a reciprocal sawtooth design.</p>

  <p>The field of the typical Chichi has an all-over pattern of
  small geometric design; and its main border stripe has rosettes
  separated by diagonal ribbon-like bars, as shown in Plate
  <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig. 6 (opp. Page 226).</p>

  <p>Rugs from the Karabagh district may frequently be recognised
  by the Persian influence in the drawing of their patterns.</p>

  <p>Genghas may readily be distinguished from other classes of
  this group by the fact that the weft crosses more than twice and
  frequently many times, between every two rows of knots, which are
  not appressed, so that the weft, as it encircles the warp,
  appears at the back like a narrow beaded surface.</p>

  <p>Daghestans, Kabistans, and Shirvans have so many different
  patterns that it is not always easy to distinguish the classes;
  but it will be some assistance to remember that the border design
  of wine cup and serrated leaf (Plate <a href="#pi">I</a>, Fig. 1,
  opp. Page 226) is found in about one half of the Shirvans, and
  that the bracket design (Plate J, Fig. 19, opp. Page 228) is
  peculiar to Daghestans and Kabistans.</p>

  <p class="tb">The small Central Asiatic group is not only unlike
  other groups, but may naturally be divided into three sub-groups,
  which are also distinct from one another and contain well-defined
  classes, viz.:</p>

  <p class="indent3">(<i>a</i>) Afghan, Royal Bokhara, Princess
  Bokhara, Tekke, Khiva, Yomud, and Beshire.</p>

  <p class="indent3">(<i>b</i>) Samarkand, Kashgar, and
  Yarkand.</p>

  <p class="indent3">(<i>c</i>) Beluchistan.</p>

  <p>In the first sub-group the prevailing colours are dark reds
  and browns with minor quantities of blue, green, and ivory. The
  Afghans are almost always of large size, and may be recognised at
  once by the broad web of the ends and the large octagonal shaped
  figures placed in contact in perpendicular rows. The Royal
  Bokharas are smaller, the end webs are not so wide, the octagons
  are never in contact and are separated diagonally by
  diamond-shaped figures. The Princess Bokharas and many Tekkes
  have the Katchli pattern. The Yomuds resemble the other classes
  of this sub-group in colour; but in the fields, diamond designs
  have entirely replaced the octagons.</p>

  <p>The rugs of sub-group &ldquo;b&rdquo; almost always have
  cotton warp; whereas the rugs of sub-groups &ldquo;a&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;c&rdquo; invariably have woollen or goat&rsquo;s hair
  warp.</p>

  <p>The Samarkands are somewhat similar in colours and patterns to
  Chinese rugs, but may be distinguished by the fact that they
  almost invariably have three border stripes, whereas the Chinese
  usually have only one or two. The Kashgar and Yarkand also show
  Chinese influence.</p>

  <p>The Beluchistans with brown, blue, green, and claret colours
  may be identified at once by their long embroidered webs at each
  end.</p>

  <p>In the determination of the class to which a rug belongs, the
  pattern first of all attracts attention; and if it be one
  peculiar to a single class, it is an important guide. But in the
  great majority of cases, this will not be sufficient. It is,
  therefore, desirable to observe if the designs be floral or
  geometric, if the colours be subdued or obtrusive, if the knot be
  Sehna or Ghiordes, if the warp be cotton<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span> or
  wool. The variations in finish of sides and ends are also an
  index of the class. The pattern and these few technical details
  are the only characteristics by which most dealers attempt to
  determine the different kinds of rugs. But in the case of half of
  them, such evidence is far from conclusive. The back should be
  even more carefully examined than the front; because here are
  shown those subtle, but nevertheless positive distinctions,
  relating to the manner of tying the knot and the treatment of
  warp and weft, which are the most permanent tribal
  characteristics of Oriental weaving. It should be noticed, then,
  if each thread of warp encircled by the yarn that forms the knot
  lies in the same plane parallel with the surface and is equally
  prominent; or if one to each knot be depressed below the other,
  or if it be doubled under the other so as to be concealed. It
  should also be noticed if the weft be coloured or uncoloured, of
  fine or of coarse diameter; and if a thread of weft crosses only
  once or two or more times from side to side between every two
  rows of knots. Furthermore, the knots themselves should be
  carefully scrutinised to see if each row of them is firmly
  pressed down upon the weft, if each knot has a length equal or
  exceeding its width, if the yarn of which they are formed is
  drawn tight against the warp, and if it is loosely or closely
  spun. Only by consideration of all these different points, and
  sometimes even more, such as the nature of the colours, the
  character of wool, and the manner in which it is spun, is it
  possible to determine doubtful cases of identification.</p>

  title="a" /></span>S those who have expert knowledge of the value
  of Oriental rugs are exceedingly few, compared with those who
  admire and wish to own them, the object of this chapter is to
  make suggestions regarding a proper selection, when purchasing,
  and to point out some of the pitfalls that beset the
  inexperienced.</p>

  <p>In estimating the value of any rug, three distinct qualities
  are to be considered: rarity, artistic beauty, and utility.</p>

  <p>Rarity may depend on the age of a rug, the locality where it
  was woven, or its type. In determining the age, which as a rule
  is greatly exaggerated, a number of facts should be considered.
  One is the condition resulting from wear; though at times this is
  misleading, since of two pieces, one may have been handled with
  almost religious solicitude and the other exposed to the elements
  and to hard usage. Moreover, an artificial appearance of natural
  wear is sometimes counterfeited. Another is the pattern, since,
  as has been shown in the case of antique carpets, the character
  of drawing changed with succeeding periods. Even when the
  patterns of old carpets are copied in modern pieces, a
  distinction is usually discernible to a careful observer. The
  colours, too, play an important part in determining age; for not
  only are some characteristic of different periods, as particular
  shades of yellow and green of Chinese rugs and the blue of
  Persian; but the mellowing influences of time, acting through the
  agencies of exposure and wear, cause effects that cannot be
  produced by any artificial process.</p>

  <p>Occasionally the time when a rug is made is recorded in Arabic
  numbers woven above a word denoting &ldquo;year.&rdquo; If they
  are indistinct on account of the length of the nap, they may be
  more clearly read in reverse order at the back. In the following
  lines, each of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id=
  "Page_296">296</a></span> them is represented below the one in
  our own notation, to which it corresponds.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
    <a name="symbols" id="symbols"></a><img src=
    "images/symbols.png" width="400" height="93" alt=
    "Arabic numerals" title="" />
  </div>

  <p>These numbers represent not the Christian but the Mohammedan
  year, which, dating from the time of the Hegira, began about the
  middle of July 622, or a little before the actual flight from
  Medina. It should also be remembered that the lunar and not the
  solar year is considered in Moslem chronology; which, according
  to our reckoning, gains about one year in every thirty-three and
  seven tenths years. To calculate, then, the year of our time
  corresponding with the year expressed in the rug, from the number
  should be subtracted one thirty-three and seven tenths part of
  itself, and then should be added six hundred and twenty-two.
  Thus, if the year 1247 was woven in the rug, our corresponding
  year would be <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1247 less 37 (or
  1210) plus 622, or 1832. When such dates appear in old rugs, they
  are generally to be depended on, but in modern ones they are more
  likely to be antedated to give the effect of greater age.</p>

  <p>With reference to the time when woven, rugs may conveniently
  be divided into three broad classes; Antique rugs or carpets made
  over two centuries ago; old rugs made fifty or more years ago;
  and modern rugs made since the introduction of aniline dyes, or
  within the last fifty years.</p>

  <p>The number of antique carpets that exist is undetermined, as
  it is impossible to estimate how many remain in Oriental mosques
  and palaces. Nor has any complete catalogue been made of those
  that are owned in Europe and America. They consist principally of
  the products of Persia, Asia Minor, Armenia, and China. Many
  belong to the museums and the remainder to sovereigns and wealthy
  collectors. Like rare porcelains and old paintings, their value
  increases with each passing year; and the prices received for
  them range according to the fancy and caprice of the purchaser.
  They are the most valued and the most costly of all rugs.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 66. Kurdish Prayer
    Kilim</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>The number of rugs over fifty years of age, but not belonging
  to the previous class, is very large. A few are sufficiently
  prized to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id=
  "Page_297">297</a></span>be placed in art museums, some belong to
  collectors, large numbers embellish the halls and drawing rooms
  of people of refinement, and others are yearly brought from the
  Orient; but dealers and the public already realise that their
  numbers are limited. Even now they are searched for in the
  remotest corners of every rug-producing country; and in a few
  years the last, now cherished as family heirlooms, will have been
  exchanged for western gold. Almost all are well woven, though
  some are too much worn to be trodden longer under foot. None are
  treated with aniline dyes, but the colours mellowed by time are
  exceptionally good and frequently contain rare tones
  characteristic of the first class. Moreover, large numbers
  contain emblems of a symbolism still shrouded in mysteries that
  increase their fascination. On the whole, this is the choicest
  stock from which to choose elegant carpetings for luxurious
  homes. When it is considered that rugs of this class are
  beginning to disappear from the market, the prices at which they
  may be purchased are moderate compared with the prices of more
  modern pieces.</p>

  <p>The great majority of existing Oriental rugs have been woven
  within the last fifty years. A few of them, including many of the
  newest, have colours that compare favourably with those of older
  pieces; but a large number show the effect of aniline dyes. Some
  woven by nomads or dwellers in remote villages, without thought
  of sale, have designs and workmanship such as have characterised
  the fabrics of these people for past generations; but others,
  which are the products of the work-house system, though well
  woven as a rule, lack the charm of spontaneous individuality. Age
  alone has little influence in determining the value of these
  modern rugs, since they have not yet become rare; yet even in
  them the wear of time affects their other qualities. Other things
  being equal, they cost less than the old and the antique
  rugs.</p>

  <p>The locality where a rug was woven is also to be considered in
  determining its rarity and therefore its value. Of the countless
  carpets that once existed in Egypt, of the very early rugs of
  Caucasia and Turkestan, not a piece remains; but if one were to
  be found it would be almost priceless. The antique carpets of
  Syria, or of Kirman, Shiraz, and Tabriz, woven over three
  centuries ago, are more valuable than others of equally good
  workmanship, of which relatively large numbers remain. So, too,
  of the rugs classed as old, but falling short of the venerable
  age of the real antiques,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298"
  id="Page_298">298</a></span> those which are now difficult to be
  obtained on account of their scarcity, are more valuable than
  those which are being produced in larger numbers. Rugs such as
  the Joshaghan, Tiflis, and many others of sixty or more years of
  age, are no longer woven. Modern products from the same districts
  may adopt the old names, but they are not the same. Accordingly,
  it will be only a short time when they too will disappear from
  the market. Good examples of such pieces should therefore receive
  more careful consideration on the part of purchasers and
  collectors, as their value is increasing with each passing
  year.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the rarity of an old rug is often independent of
  its age or the locality where it was made, and is due to its
  peculiar type. For instance, the Ming Rugs of China with silver
  threads and the so-called Garden Carpets of Iran represent types
  rather than localities. Likewise the Hunting Carpets of Persia,
  the Holbein Carpets of Asia Minor, and the Dragon Carpets of
  Armenia, represent, as far as we know, the textile craft of no
  well-defined district of limited area, as is the case of modern
  rugs, but rather rare types. Such pieces are valuable, not alone
  on account of their age, but also because they represent these
  rare types.</p>

  <p>A rug is also valued for its artistic beauty. The innumerable
  rugs which centuries ago were in daily use soon disappeared, and
  only those intended for palaces or temples have been preserved.
  It is but natural, then, that the antique carpets representing
  the highest art of their time should be not only rare but also
  beautiful. Yet even in them is often a distinction that affects
  their value. Fortunately, very many of the larger number of rugs
  of less age, but classed as old, likewise possess artistic
  beauty. This chiefly depends on the drawing and the
  colouring.</p>

  <p>It will be noticed that almost without exception careful
  drawing accompanies workmanship of a high class. This is partly
  due to the facts that the more excellent the weave the easier it
  is to clearly define patterns; and that on shortness of nap,
  which as a rule is found in closely woven rugs, depends accuracy
  of delineation. The charm of rugs often depends, also, on the
  graceful flow of lines, the careful balance of different parts of
  patterns, and the proper co-ordination between border and field.
  Careful attention should accordingly be given to the drawing when
  selecting a rug.</p>

  <p>The artistic beauty of Oriental rugs depends still more on
  the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id=
  "Page_299">299</a></span> colouring, since, as has been elsewhere
  expressed, drawing, which is intellectual, finds its highest
  development in the Occident, and colouring, which is sensuous,
  finds its highest development in the Orient. It at once suggests
  sumptuous luxury. In all of the antique carpets that remain and
  in very many rugs over fifty years of age, all the colours
  employed in a single piece are in tones of perfect harmony, and
  are so placed with reference to one another that the effect is
  most agreeable. But in some of the modern pieces, such as are
  produced in parts of Asia Minor and Caucasia, are colours which,
  like discordant notes of music, grate harshly on the senses. The
  most pleasing effect is when colours of border and field are
  complementary, yet so in harmony as to accentuate the qualities
  of each.</p>

  <p>There are also colours which, independent of their
  association, are in themselves good or bad. The best are found in
  the antique carpets woven when the art of the dyer was an
  honourable profession. The colours are also very good in still
  later pieces; but for a century now some of the finest have not
  been used, and even the secret of producing them has been lost.
  Here and there dyers and weavers cling to early traditions, so
  that among modern rugs are many examples of good colouring; but
  the most recent pieces, excepting when softened by artificial
  processes, often display harsh and garish colours. This
  distinction is in a measure due to the fact that old colours were
  largely produced by vegetable dyes and the modern are too often
  produced by aniline. Not infrequently both vegetable and aniline
  colours are used in the same piece, and sometimes the quantity of
  aniline colour is so small that it is scarcely objectionable; but
  as a rule it is best never to purchase a rug that is so
  tainted.</p>

  <p>One objection to the use of aniline dyes is that by removing
  some of the natural oil of the wool they are apt to make it
  brittle, so that it is less able to stand wear. Another is that
  in time some of the dyes, which have been applied collectively to
  produce a single colour, will fade or even disappear, so that the
  final colour may be a most undesirable shade not in harmony with
  those that surround it. If the fibres are brittle and become
  harsher to the touch when wet with water, it is an indication
  that aniline dyes have been used. Another test is the application
  of weak vegetable acids, which will make the colour spread if
  produced by aniline dyes, but are not likely to affect it if
  produced by vegetable dyes. Many na<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>tive weavers can
  distinguish by placing the wool in their mouths, when they
  experience a sweet or bitter taste, according as vegetable or
  aniline dyes have been used. It is a mistake, however, to assume
  that the dyes are aniline because the wool has a brighter colour
  at the surface of the nap than at the foundation; or because the
  colour spreads when wet with water; since in time even some of
  the vegetable colours will fade; and when fresh they will run
  during the first washing in water, but afterwards they are little
  affected either by water or weak acids.</p>

  <p>Even when the same colours and the same kind of dyes were
  used, there is a marked distinction in the appearance of old and
  of recently woven rugs, which is due to wear as well as exposure
  to sun and weather. The effect of time, imperceptible at first,
  is shown in rich tones of remarkable softness and beauty, that
  add greatly to the value of a rug. It accordingly happens that
  artificial processes are adopted to create as far as possible the
  same results without the lapse of time. Some of these are as
  novel as were the efforts of the distinguished viceroy of King-te
  Chin, in the reign of Kang-hi, to produce antique
  porcelains.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Henry Savage Landor
  says<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> that &ldquo;to manufacture
  &lsquo;Antique Carpets&rsquo; is one of the most lucrative
  branches of modern Persian carpet making. The new carpets are
  spread in the bazar in the middle of the street, where it is most
  crowded, and trampled upon for days or weeks, according to the
  days required, foot passengers and their donkeys, mules and
  camels making a point of treading on them in order to &lsquo;add
  to age&rsquo; in the manufacturer&rsquo;s goods. When
  sufficiently worn down the carpet is removed, brushed, and
  ordinarily sold for double or treble the actual price, owing to
  its antiquity.&rdquo;</p>

  <h4><i>COLOUR PLATE XI&mdash;CHINESE RUG</i></h4>

  <p><i>This large Chinese carpet represents some of the best
  workmanship of the Keen-lung period. In it are shown the graceful
  drawing of leaf, fruit, flower, and butterfly, and the dainty
  colouring of blue, yellow, brown, and apricot on a field of ivory
  that are so characteristic of this time. The usual balance of
  designs throughout the field is maintained with precision; but,
  as is not always the case, different motives occupy corresponding
  positions. Thus a cluster of leaves and fruit may be balanced
  with a cluster of leaves and flowers. The conventional drawing of
  the corners and the somewhat formal panel that surrounds the
  central medallion give to the pattern strength of character while
  they detract nothing from its beauty.</i></p>

  </div>

  <p>Whatever may be their character, the methods employed to give
  softened effects to the colours are known as
  &ldquo;washing.&rdquo; Most of those in vogue in the Orient, such
  as washing with lime water, do little real injury. In this
  country to artificially mellow the colours has become a regular
  business of firms, who guard the secret of their different
  methods. Some use ammonia, borax, and soap, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>which
  also do very little injury to the rug. Others use chloride of
  lime, boracic acid, vinegar, or oxalic acid, that remove some of
  the natural oils of the wool and accordingly impair its qualities
  for wear. In fact, pieces are occasionally injured to the extent
  that the wool has become brittle and may readily be plucked out.
  Nevertheless, it does not necessarily follow that all rugs washed
  with an acid solution have been seriously injured; but the
  colours never have the same richness as those which have been
  softened by natural processes operating for a long period of
  years. To be sure, rugs that have been washed are often more
  attractive than they were in their raw colours; but the older,
  more beautiful rugs with genuine tones mellowed by time are
  always to be preferred. Over ninety per cent of the Kermanshahs,
  Sarouks, Kashans, Tabriz, Muskabads, Mahals, and Gorevans, and a
  large percentage of all other modern rugs sold in this country,
  have been treated by some artificial process to soften their
  colours or give them the appearance of age. It is generally
  necessary, when selecting a large rug for a floor covering, to
  accept a washed piece; but when a smaller rug or a runner will
  meet the requirements, it is preferable to choose the older
  unwashed piece, which, as a rule, is more beautiful and costs but
  little more. In the case of most pieces, the tones of colour are
  sufficient to enable one who is experienced to distinguish
  between those that are artificially aged and those that are not.
  In the case of others, a simple test is to rub them thoroughly
  with a wet rag; when, if acid or chloride of lime has been used,
  it can generally be detected by the odour.</p>

  <p>The artistic beauty of a rug also depends somewhat on the
  fineness of the nap; as the soft, floccy fibres of some wools
  acquire a velvety appearance, or give to the colours a sheen and
  a lustre compared with which other rugs look harsh and coarse.
  For instance, the rugs of Shiraz and Meshed, the Beluchistans,
  and many Bokharas are noted for the lustre of their colours; but
  on the other hand many of the rugs of Asia Minor and Caucasia
  have colours that are without lustre, and the rugs of India which
  are made of dead or &ldquo;Chunam&rdquo; wool, seem lifeless.</p>

  <p>When selecting any rug, then, the purchaser should carefully
  observe if the patterns are well drawn and their different parts
  show a proper balance. He should observe if the colour tones are
  harmonious with one another, if each colour in itself is good,
  and if they have been softened by natural processes acting for a
  long time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id=
  "Page_302">302</a></span> And he should notice if the wool is
  coarse, dead, and lustreless, or if it has a sheen and glint in
  the light of day; for these are the qualities that make up the
  artistic beauty of a rug.</p>

  <p>The utility to be derived from rugs that properly belong to
  museums and collectors receives small consideration, though even
  with them the more perfect their condition the more valuable they
  are. But in case of the great majority of rugs, which are
  intended for use as well as for ornament, their utility is an
  important consideration to the purchaser. Rugs that have warp and
  weft of strong yarn and a close firm texture, will wear better
  than others. Also, such rugs as Bijars, in which one thread of
  warp to each knot is doubled under the other, will be found to
  wear better than such rugs as Mosuls which have each thread of
  warp equally prominent at the back. For durability, long nap is
  also to be preferred to short, since it protects the foundations
  of the knots from wearing and becoming loose.</p>

  <p>Before purchasing an old rug, it should be spread on the floor
  to see if it lies flat and if its shape is regular. It should be
  examined by daylight and not by electric light, which gives a
  false impression of colour and sheen. It should be held up with
  the back turned to the purchaser, and carefully examined for weak
  spots through which the light may pass; since, when so held, many
  pieces which seem in good condition when lying on the floor,
  resemble a sieve. The foundation threads should also be carefully
  inspected, as sometimes they rot and will tear with slight
  tension. Moreover, as the selvage or overcasting of the sides and
  the webs of the ends are intended primarily not for ornament but
  for protection, it should be noted if they are in good condition.
  Sometimes the webs of the ends are entirely gone, so that
  continual fraying of the nap is prevented with difficulty.
  Sometimes the selvage or overcasting of the sides is broken and
  some of the threads of warp are injured. Or the sides may be well
  protected by a stout overcasting; but on examination it will be
  seen that it is not the original finishing, and that some of the
  border has disappeared. Again, it may have been overcast too
  tightly, so that the sides curl and turn under, and thus expose
  the border to injury when trodden on. Careful examination will
  often reveal surprises. In many old rugs the field is full of
  rents, that have been sewn together; in others entire pieces have
  been removed, so that they are no longer of their original
  length; or parts of the border are gone, or even the whole of it
  has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id=
  "Page_303">303</a></span> replaced by the border of another rug;
  yet all so deftly done that the changes are scarcely
  noticeable.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, old pieces, if otherwise meritorious, are not to
  be discarded on account of a few imperfections, since what can be
  accomplished in the hands of a careful repairer is remarkable.
  Broken threads of warp and weft can be mended; missing knots can
  be replaced with others of similar yarn; crooked pieces can be
  straightened by loosening here and stretching there; borders that
  curl can be flattened by removing the yarn and overcasting again
  more carefully. In fact, if the nap be not so worn that the
  foundation of warp and weft is exposed, it is far better to
  choose an old rug with some rents than a new one with garish
  aniline dyes. Nor should a piece be slighted, because the
  brownish black areas of wool dyed with iron pyrites are worn low;
  since often the most beautiful effects are obtained by a surface
  of brighter colours standing out in relief, on account of the
  worn blackish nap that surrounds it. Now and then a bargain can
  be had by buying a rug which, because of some imperfection that
  is not serious, has been passed by; and now and then a piece
  reeking with dirt has proved, when properly cleansed, to be a
  gem.</p>

  <p>The foundation, consisting of the warp and weft, receives but
  little consideration from purchasers; yet it is one of the most
  important indices of the quality of a rug, and its strength is
  one of the most necessary conditions for utility. The warp is
  best observed at the ends. In most Chinese and Indian rugs and in
  some of the Persian, it is of cotton; in others it is of wool or
  goat&rsquo;s hair. In the Chinese rugs the diameter of the
  threads of warp is much smaller than the diameter of the threads
  of the weft, and has little strength, but in almost all other
  rugs it is at least as large and as stout. The weft may readily
  be observed at the back. In very many of the best rugs, it
  consists of fine spun wool; but in many modern ones, it is of
  coarse wool or cotton. The number of knots to the square inch
  does not of itself demonstrate the quality of texture, since a
  rug may have only a few knots of coarse diameter and be firmly
  woven, or it may have many knots of fine diameter and be loosely
  woven; but in the same class the better rug has generally more
  knots than a poorer one. When selecting a rug, then, the back
  should be most carefully observed; for here may be seen if the
  yarn that forms the knots is well spun, if the knots themselves
  are drawn tight and well pressed down, and if the
  threads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id=
  "Page_304">304</a></span> of weft are carefully inserted and have
  a texture that indicates fine workmanship. Almost invariably it
  will be found that if the back of a rug shows good material, and
  has an appearance of firmness and skilful, painstaking weaving,
  the front will correspond with good colours and careful
  drawing.</p>

  <p>The value of antique carpets, which depends to some extent on
  their size, and to a much greater extent on their rarity and
  character, is constantly increasing; for the reason that their
  number is limited and each year they are more highly appreciated.
  It is, therefore, impossible to affix even approximate prices;
  but the sums paid at the Yerkes sale in 1910, when some thirty
  pieces were sold at auction for an average of about $9,400, will
  serve as a guide. The following are some of the pieces sold and
  the prices realised:</p>

  <p>The value of rugs over fifty years of age but not sufficiently
  old to belong to the antique class also depends as much on the
  technique of weave, drawing, colouring, and rarity as on the
  size; yet even this must be taken into consideration. In
  proportion to their size the most expensive of these rugs are the
  Kirmans, Sehnas, and Niris from Persia; the Ghiordes and Ladiks
  from Asia Minor; the Daghestans and Kabistans from Caucasia; and
  the Royal Bokharas and Yomuds from Central Asia. Considering both
  utility and attractiveness the least expensive are probably the
  Sarabends and Mosuls from the Persian group, the Yuruks from Asia
  Minor, Kazaks and Tcherkess from Caucasia, and Afghans
  and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id=
  "Page_305">305</a></span> Beluchistans from Central Asia. As is
  the case with antique carpets, the prices of all old rugs in good
  condition are steadily advancing.</p>

  <p>There is likewise a tendency for the prices of modern rugs to
  increase with each year, since on account of the gradual opening
  of Oriental countries to the markets of the world, and the
  greater demand for rugs, the wages of weavers are increasing.
  Some of them, as the Tabriz, Gorevans, Kermanshahs, Muskabads,
  Mahals, Sarouks, and Kashans, are now made almost exclusively
  under the direction of the work-house system, and are sold at
  prices that fluctuate but slightly. But in a short time the
  prices of all of them will doubtless be higher.</p>

  <p>When a rug of carpet size is required, the Kermanshahs are
  generally preferred on account of their soft colouring and
  refined patterns, that harmonise with the furnishings of most
  reception rooms. Less expensive and more showy are the Gorevans,
  which are suitable for halls or dining rooms. In the Afghans,
  which are splendid rugs for a den, are combined durability with a
  moderate price. Within recent years some of the Indian rugs, as
  the Amritsars and Lahores, have been growing in favour, as they
  not only have good colours, artistic patterns, and exceedingly
  good texture, but are reasonable in price. Of smaller rugs
  required both for ornament and use, the Shiraz, Feraghan, Mosul,
  Bergamo, Tcherkess, Bokhara, and Beluchistan are desirable.</p>

  <p>As is the case with other works of art, so much deception can
  be practised in the sale of rugs that a purchaser cannot use too
  much circumspection. Sometimes through ignorance or with
  intention, a dealer will declare that the wool of a rug which has
  been coloured with aniline dyes has been coloured with vegetable
  dyes only; that a rug washed with acid has matured naturally;
  that a new rug which has been artificially worn almost to the
  knot is an antique; or that a particular rug belongs to the class
  desired, as where a Shirvan is offered for a Shiraz or a Bijar
  for a Bergamo, which ordinarily are worth much more. It is,
  accordingly, discreet to buy only of such firms as have a
  reputation which is above reproach; and if for any reason it is
  difficult to learn the standing of a firm, the purchaser would do
  well to make an effort to test its reliability by inquiring about
  the qualities of some class of rugs with which he is familiar
  before purchasing others; and if there appears to be any
  intention to deceive, he should at once look elsewhere. In any
  event, he should take a guarantee that the<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span> rug
  purchased is as represented. Firms that have gained an honourable
  reputation by honest dealing deserve the patronage of the public,
  and will always be found ready to make restitution if any mistake
  has been made.</p>

  <p>At times, the best rugs may be bought at auctions and at the
  fairest prices. Auctions such as the Yerkes, where estates are
  being closed or where firms are dissolved, occasionally occur,
  when every opportunity is given the purchaser to thoroughly
  examine in advance pieces which are sold without reservation to
  the highest bidder. On such occasions, rare pieces are sometimes
  bought at very moderate prices. But as a rule, unless the
  purchaser is a good judge and has previously carefully examined a
  coveted piece in broad daylight, it is better not to buy at
  auctions. During the sale it is impossible to properly examine a
  rug. The glare of electric light thrown upon it gives a too
  favourable impression of its beauty. The competitive bids of
  other real or fictitious purchasers and the words of the
  auctioneer too often lead beyond the dictates of good judgment.
  At such times one would do well to remember the old words
  <i>caveat emptor</i>.</p>

    and the boundless desert wastes. But as Egypt long ago ceased
    to be a rug-producing country, and none of its ancient rugs
    remain, it will only be briefly referred to in this work,
    though symbolic designs which had their origin there during the
    Caliphate or even earlier were adopted by foreign weavers and
    occasionally appear with modified form in modern rugs.</p>

    Birdwood has made the statement that &ldquo;A deep and
    complicate symbolism, originating in Babylonia and possibly in
    India, pervades every denomination of Oriental carpet. Thus the
    carpet itself prefigures space and eternity, and the general
    pattern or filling, as it is technically termed, the fleeting,
    finite universe of animated beauty. Every colour has its
    significance; and the design, whether mythological or natural,
    human, bestial, or floral, has its hidden meaning. Even the
    representatives of men hunting wild beasts have their special
    indications. So have the natural flowers of Persia their
    symbolism, wherever they are introduced, generally following
    that of their colours. The very irregularities either in
    drawing or colouring, to be observed in almost every Oriental
    carpet, and invariably in Turkoman carpets, are seldom
    accidental, the usual deliberate intention being to avert the
    evil eye and insure good luck.&rdquo;</p>

    prayer rugs, the engaged columns support a high arch over which
    a panel rests above a figured spandrel. The outlines of each of
    these parts suggest most forcibly the drawing of the prayer
    rug, and the resemblance is carried even further; for
    corresponding with the border stripes is the chiselled masonry

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
